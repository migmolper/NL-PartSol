abstract = {Soil liquefaction describes a loss of strength of saturated sand upon sudden or cyclic loading. A slight disturbance of such a soil's fabric might lead to severe damage, e.g. the collapse of sea dikes. Accurate modeling of the state transition between saturated soil and a liquefied soil-water mixture, as well as post-liquefaction phenomena, is crucial for the prediction of such damage. However, developing an appropriate numerical model remains a challenging problem, especially when the simulation involves dynamic large deformation processes. In order to make a first step towards an accurate simulation of soil liquefaction, a two-phase formulation of the finite element method (FEM) in conjunction with the elastoplastic UBC3D-PLM model is investigated. The performance of this approach is analyzed based on a shaking table benchmark.},

abstract = {In this paper, AQUAgpusph, a new free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) software accelerated with OpenCL, is described. The main differences and progress with respect to other existing alternatives are considered. These are the use of the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework instead of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), the implementation of the most popular boundary conditions, the easy customization of the code to different problems, the extensibility with regard to Python scripts, and the runtime output which allows the tracking of simulations in real time, or a higher frequency in saving some results without a significant performance lost. These modifications are shown to improve the solver speed, the results quality, and allow for a wider areas of application. AQUAgpusph has been designed trying to provide researchers and engineers with a valuable tool to test and apply the SPH method. Three practical applications are discussed in detail. The evolution of a dam break is used to quantify and compare the computational performance and modeling accuracy with the most popular SPH Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated alternatives. The dynamics of a coupled system, a Tuned Liquid Damper (TLD), is discussed in order to show the integration capabilities of the solver with external dynamics. Finally, the sloshing flow inside a nuclear reactor is simulated in order to show the capabilities of the solver to treat 3-D problems with complex geometries and of industrial interest. 

PROGRAM SUMMARY
Program title: AQUAgpusph 1.5 Catalogue identifier: AEVG{\_}v1{\_}0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEVG{\_}v1{\_}0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1702666 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 75117178 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++, OpenCL, Python. Computer: Linux based computers with OpenCL support. Operating system: Linux. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Code is parallelized with OpenCL. Classification: 1.5. Nature of problem: Complex geometry or heavily fragmented free surface fluid dynamics problems where mesh based method cannot be successfully applied. Solution method: SPH is a meshless method where the fluid domain is discretized as a set of fluid particles. The fields in the fluid domain are smoothed using a kernel function, that allows to develop differential operators from the flow field values in scattered sets of particles. Running time: Using an AMD HD-7970 graphic device 2×105 time steps of a 2-D simulation, with 105 particles and 8×102 neighs per particle, is requiring around 9 h of computation. A more detailed performance analysis will be carried out in the practical application section herein.},

@article{Phuong2016,
abstract = {The installation of displacement piles in sand leads to severe changes in the stress state, density and soil properties around the pile tip and shaft, and therefore has a significant influence on the pile bearing capacity. Most current numerical methods predicting pile capacity do not take installation effects into account, as large deformations can lead to mesh distortion and non-converging solutions. In this study, the material point method (MPM) is applied to simulate the pile installation process and subsequent static pile loading tests. MPM is an extension of the finite element method (FEM), which is capable of modelling large deformations and soil-structure interactions. This study utilizes the moving mesh algorithm where a redefined computational mesh is applied in the convective phase. This allows a fine mesh to be maintained around the pile tip during the installation process and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme, especially for contact formulation. For the analyses a hypoplastic constitutive model for sand is used, which takes into account density and stress dependent behaviour. The model performs well in situations with significant stress level changes because it accounts for very high stresses at the pile tip. Numerical results agree with centrifuge experiments at a gravitational level of 40g. This analysis confirms the importance of pile installation effects in numerical simulations, as well as the proposed numerical approach's ability to simulate installation and static load tests of jacked displacement piles.},

The resulting non-linear, discrete equations are solved using Newton's method combined with either the conjugate gradient method or the generalized minimum residual method. These Newton-Krylov solvers are implemented in a matrix-free fashion for numerical efficiency. A description of the algorithms and evaluation of their performance is presented. On all test problems, if the time step is chosen appropriately, the implicit solution technique is more efficient than an explicit method without loss of desired features in the solutions. In a dramatic example, time steps 10,000 times the explicit step size are possible for the large deformation compression of a cylindrical billet at 1.2{\%} the computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The presented second-order MPM uses a special set of piecewise quadratic shape functions to circumvent the well-known issue of producing zero nodal mass contributions. To mitigate the effect of the standard MPM to produce highly oscillating stresses across cell interfaces, we have carried over our ideas obtained from the derivation of the second-order MPM to the Dual Domain Material Point (DDMP) Method, too. The resulting second-order DDMP Method produces a smoother stress distribution across the entire computational domain while being able to profit from the improved convergence rates of second-order finite elements. In a numerical example from geotechnical engineering applications, we illustrate the practical application of our enhanced Material Point and DDMP Methods by simulating a cone penetration.},

Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

abstract = {The modelling of geomechanics problems can require a method that allows large deformations and non-linear material behaviour, in this respect the Generalised Material Point Method (GIMPM) is ideal. A fully implicit version of GIMPM has recently been developed for geomechanics problems and some aspects of its implementation are described here. An area that has received less attention in material point methods is that conventional analysis techniques constructed in terms of stress and strain are unable to resolve structural instabilities such as shear banding. This is because they do not contain any measure of the length of the microstructure of the material analysed, such as molecule size or grain structure. Gradient theories provide extensions of the classical equations with additional higher-order terms. The use of length scales makes it possible to model a finite thickness shear band which is not possible with traditional methods. Much work has been done on using gradient theories to include the effect of microstructure in the finite element method (and other numerical analysis techniques) however this yet to be combined with material point methods. In this paper the key equations that are required to extend the implicit GIMPM method to include gradient elasto-plasticity are detailed.},

The interaction between a structural element and soil is investigated to validate the applicability of the parallelisation strategy. Two techniques are developed to parallelise the interpolation from soil particles to nodes to avoid a data race; the technique that is based on workload parallelisation across threads over the nodes has a higher computational efficiency. Benchmark problems of surface footing penetration and a submarine landslide are analysed to quantify the speedup of GPU parallel computing over sequential simulations on the central processing unit. The maximum speedup with the GPU used is ∼30 for single-precision calculations and decreases to ∼20 for double-precision calculations.},

If the relative acceleration of the fluid phase relative to the skeleton is neglected, the equations describing the problem can be written in terms of skeleton displacements (or velocities) and pore pressures. This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold. As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the same order of interpolation for the field variables. This paper proposes a generalization of the fractional-step method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems, which allows to circumvent BB restrictions in the incompressibility limit, thus making it possible to use elements with the same order of interpolation.},

Moreover, the spaces where field variables are approximated have to fulfill additional requirements ensuring stability. Stress-velocity-pore pressure formulations in FE analysis provide accurate results for wave propagation and failure analysis. However, finite elements present important limitations when deformations are large. The purpose of this paper is to present a stabilized Fractional Step, SPH algorithm which combines the advantages of the SPH method for large deformation problems with those of the Taylor Galerkin algorithm used within the finite element framework.},

abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless Lagrangian method that has been successfully applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), solid mechanics and many other multi-physics problems. Using the method to solve transport phenomena in process engineering requires the simulation of several days to weeks of physical time. Based on the high computational demand of CFD such simulations in 3D need a computation time of years so that a reduction to a 2D domain is inevitable. In this paper gpuSPHASE, a new open-source 2D SPH solver implementation for graphics devices, is developed. It is optimized for simulations that must be executed with thousands of frames per second to be computed in reasonable time. A novel caching algorithm for Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) shared memory is proposed and implemented. The software is validated and the performance is evaluated for the well established dambreak test case.

It is demonstrated that the fidelity of information transfer from a particle representation to the computational grid is strongly dependent on particle density and location. In addition, use of non-uniform grids and even non-uniform particle sizes are shown to introduce error. An enhancement to the projection operation is developed which makes use of already available velocity gradient information. This enhancement facilitates exact projection of linear functions and reduces the dependence of projection accuracy on particle location and density for non- linear functions. The efficacy of this formulation for reducing error is demonstrated in solid mechanics simulations in one and two dimensions.},

This paper use the material point method (MPM) to simulate the long runout landslides. The basic theories and the solution procedure of MPM are presented first. Then a landside experiment with the soil modelled by aluminium bars is simulated to validate this method for landslide analysis. The numerical results of the final configuration and the failure surface of the landslide agree well with the experiment results. Finally, the landslide of Erman Mountain in China Sichuan province is simulated. The velocities, affected areas, flow intensity and impact forces on structures are investigated.},

abstract = {The rheology of caramel was determined as a function of processing temperature and hydrocolloid additions. As the processing temperature increased the water content decreased and the caramel viscosity increased. X-ray diffraction showed that although crystalline fat was present, for the most part the sugars were in the amorphous state. The exception was the lowest water content caramel (7.9{\%} water w.w.b.) which had been processed to a temperature of 122{\textordmasculine}C. This had a small amount of crystalline fructose. Caramel rheology was assessed by rotational and capillary rheometry. Rotational rheometry gave information on the steady shear viscosity, the dynamic parameters (storage and loss moduli and related functions) and the creep compliance and recovery response. Capillary rheometry gave shear viscosities at high shear rates and an extensional viscosity. It was found that caramel without added hydrocolloids had behavior which was close to a Newtonian liquid. The only exception to this was the values obtained for the Trouton ratio which ranged from 10 to 40. This was considerably higher than the value of 3 for a Newtonian fluid and may reflect the difficulties in making measurements on these relatively low viscosity systems in the capillary rheometer. The viscosities obtained from steady shear, oscillation and creep were combined and three approaches were used to model the data as a function of measurement temperature and water content. An empirical statistical model using a second order polynomial, an Arrhenius fit and a Williams Landel Ferry (WLF) model. The former and the latter gave a good fit to the data although the constants used in the WLF model varied with the water content of the caramel. Arrhenius plots showed curvature particularly at low water contents. Incorporation of the hydrocolloids carrageenan and gellan gum into the caramel made the material non-Newtonian and elastic. For carrageenan incorporation in particular the Trouton ratio increased with carrageenan concentration reaching a value {\~{}}500 at a strain rate of 100s-1 for the caramel containing 0.2{\%} carrageenan It was demonstrated that incorporation of carrageenan could be used to prevent cold flow in caramels processed at relatively high water contents. Glass transition temperatures were measured by differential scanning calorimetry and calculated from the temperature dependence of the shift factors used to superimpose the oscillatory rheological data. Generally there was agreement between the two approaches although for some gellan gum containing samples the rheological Tg was about 10{\textordmasculine}C higher than the DSC value. Fragility calculated from the WLF constants for caramel was high as has been reported for sugars. The Tg for both caramel and sugar water mixtures calculated using the Couchman-Karastz equation in the water content of interest (9-15{\%} w.w.b.) was some 30-40°C higher than measured. It is suggested that this disagreement could be related to the high fragility of the sugar water systems. Isoelectric point measurements using a streaming potential technique was shown to give information on the extent of the Maillard reaction and the presence of hydrocolloids.},

abstract = {The simulation of large deformation problems, involving complex history-dependent constitutive laws, is of paramount importance in several engineering fields. Particular attention has to be paid to the choice of a suitable numerical technique such that reliable results can be obtained. In this paper, a Material Point Method (MPM) and a Galerkin Meshfree Method (GMM) are presented and verified against classical benchmarks in solid mechanics. The aim is to demonstrate the good behavior of the methods in the simulation of cohesive-frictional materials, both in static and dynamic regimes and in problems dealing with large deformations. The vast majority of MPM techniques in the literatrue are based on some sort of explicit time integration. The techniques proposed in the current work, on the contrary, are based on implicit approaches, which can also be easily adapted to the simulation of static cases. The two methods are presented so as to highlight the similarities to rather than the differences from "standard" Updated Lagrangian (UL) approaches commonly employed by the Finite Elements (FE) community. Although both methods are able to give a good prediction, it is observed that, under very large deformation of the medium, GMM lacks robustness due to its meshfree natrue, which makes the definition of the meshless shape functions more difficult and expensive than in MPM. On the other hand, the mesh-based MPM is demonstrated to be more robust and reliable for extremely large deformation cases.},

abstract = {Particle Methods are those in which the problem is represented by a discrete number of particles. Eachparticle moves accordingly with its own mass and the external/internal forces applied to it. ParticleMethods may be used for both, discrete and continuous problems. In this paper, a Particle Methodis used to solve the continuous ﬂuid mechanics equations. To evaluate the external applied forces oneach particle, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using a Lagrangian formulation are solvedat each time step. The interpolation functions are those used in the Meshless Finite Element Methodand the time integration is introduced by an implicit fractional-step method. In this manner classicalstabilization terms used in the momentum equations are unnecessary due to lack of convective termsin the Lagrangian formulation. Once the forces are evaluated, the particles move independently ofthe mesh. All the information is transmitted by the particles. Fluid–structure interaction problemsincluding free-ﬂuid-surfaces, breaking waves and ﬂuid particle separation may be easily solved withthis methodology. Copyright . 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A SPH model based on a general formulation for solid–fluid two-phase flows is proposed for suspended sediment motion in free surface flows. The water and the sediment are treated as two miscible fluids, and the multi-fluid system is discretized by a single set of SPH particles, which move with the water velocity and carry properties of the two phases. Large eddy simulation (LES) is introduced to deal with the turbulence effect, and the widely used Smagorinsky model is modified to take into account the influence of sediment particles on the turbulence. The drag force is accurately formulated by including the hindered settling effect. In the model, the water is assumed to be weakly compressible while the sediment is incompressible, and a new equation of state is proposed for the pressure in the sediment–water mixture. Dynamic boundary condition is employed to treat wall boundaries, and a new strategy of Shepard filtering is adopted to damp the pressure oscillation. The developed two-phase SPH model is validated by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions for idealized cases of still water containing both neutrally buoyant and naturally settling sand and for plane Poiseuille flows carrying neutrally buoyant particles, and is then applied to sand dumping from a line source into a water tank, where the sand cloud settles with a response of the free water surface. It is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as well as the empirical formulas. The characteristics of the settling sand cloud, the pressure field, and the flow vortices are studied. The motion of the free water surface is also discussed. The proposed two-phase SPH model is proven to be effective for numerical simulation of sand dumping into waters.},

A similar dependency is observed in the two-dimensional continuum simulations. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@phdthesis{thesis_thomas_blanc_2011,
abstract = {The study developed in this thesis is focused on numerical modeling of dynamics behavior of dry soils in the framework of small and large deformation theory and of dynamics behavior of saturated soils in the framework of small deformation theory. A numerical code has been developed to analyze such behaviors and presents three versions: - The Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of dry soils behavior in dynamic (small deformation theory) - The new Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of dry soils behavior in dynamic (large deformation theory) - The v - pw Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of saturated soils behavior in dynamic (small deformation theory) Both of them are based on a mathematical model which describes the dynamic of viscoplastic solids. The governing equations of the mathematical model behind the Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH and the new Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH are: i) the balance of momentum equation, ii) the constitutive equation and iii) the kinetic relation. The mathematical model used to describe the dynamics behavior of saturated soil is based on the u - pw model of Zienkiewicz and his team. This model represents the behavior of the mixture of solid particles and pore water. It is based on the following governing equations: i) the mass balance equations of the solid phase, of the pore water and of the mixture, ii) the momentum balance equations of the solid phase, of the pore water and of the mixture, iii) the constitutive equation and iv) the kinetic relation. In the thesis we used the Perzyna‟s model as the constitutive equation. It is a simple viscoplastic model. This constitutive equation is completed by the Von Mises yield criterion or the yield surface of the modified Cam-Clay model depending on the problem studied. The mathematical model is formulated in terms of velocity and stress for the dry soils behavior and in terms of velocity, effective stress and pore water pressure for the saturated soils behavior. This formulation avoids the shortcomings of the classical formulation of solid dynamics. The numerical tool to discretize the equations of the mathematical model is the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method (SPH). This work presents the theory and the limitations of this method. The classical SPH method presents a tensile instability when it is applied to solids. In the different versions of the Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH model, the equations of the mathematical model are first discretized in time using the Taylor-Galerkin method. In a second step the equations are discretized in space with the SPH method. The mixing between the SPH method and the Taylor-Galerkin method allows avoiding the development of the SPH tensile instability and in consequence, the new model can be used for solids modeling. The numerical code proposed in this work has been tested with 17 case studies. The results obtained with the numerical code have been compared to analytical solutions when it was possible. The results show that the proposed numerical models are accurate and useful to predict localized failures of dry and saturated soils. El estudio desarrollado en esta tesis est{\'{a}} centrado en la modelizaci{\'{o}}n num{\'{e}}rica del comportamiento din{\'{a}}mico de los suelos secos en el marco de las teor{\'{i}}as de peque{\~{n}}as y grandes deformaciones y del comportamiento din{\'{a}}mico de los suelos saturados en el marco de la teor{\'{i}}a de peque{\~{n}}as deformaciones. Un c{\'{o}}digo num{\'{e}}rico ha sido desarrollado y presenta las tres versiones siguientes: - El modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH para el an{\'{a}}lisis del comportamiento de los suelos secos en din{\'{a}}mica (peque{\~{n}}as deformaciones) - El “nuevo” modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH para el an{\'{a}}lisis del comportamiento de los suelos secos en din{\'{a}}mica (grandes deformaciones) - El modelo v – pw Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH para el an{\'{a}}lisis del comportamiento de los suelos saturados en din{\'{a}}mica (peque{\~{n}}as deformaciones) Las tres versiones se basan en un modelo matem{\'{a}}tico capaz de describir la din{\'{a}}mica de los s{\'{o}}lidos viscopl{\'{a}}sticos. Las ecuaciones del modelo matem{\'{a}}tico en el cual se basan el modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH y el “nuevo” modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH son: i) la ecuaci{\'{o}}n de balance del momento lineal, ii) la ecuaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva y iii) la relaci{\'{o}}n cin{\'{e}}tica. El modelo matem{\'{a}}tico utilizado para describir el comportamiento din{\'{a}}mico de los suelos saturados viene del modelo u - pw introducido por Zienkiewicz y su equipo. Este modelo representa el comportamiento de la mezcla de part{\'{i}}culas solidas con agua intersticial. Est{\'{a}} basado en las ecuaciones siguientes: i) las ecuaciones de balance de masa de la fase solida, del agua intersticial y de la mezcla, ii) las ecuaciones de balance del momento lineal de la fase solida, del agua intersticial y de la mezcla, iii) la ecuaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva y iv) la relaci{\'{o}}n cin{\'{e}}tica. En este trabajo la ecuaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva elegida es el modelo viscopl{\'{a}}stico de Perzyna. La ecuaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva est{\'{a}} completada por el criterio de fluencia de Von Mises o por la superficie de fluencia del modelo Cam-Clay modificada seg{\'{u}}n el problema estudiado. El modelo matem{\'{a}}tico est{\'{a}} formulado en velocidades y tensiones para el comportamiento de los suelos secos y en velocidades, tensiones efectivas y presi{\'{o}}n intersticial para los suelos saturados. Esta formulaci{\'{o}}n elimina los defectos de la formulaci{\'{o}}n cl{\'{a}}sica de la din{\'{a}}mica de s{\'{o}}lidos. La herramienta num{\'{e}}rica para discretizar las ecuaciones del modelo matem{\'{a}}tico es el m{\'{e}}todo Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Este trabajo presenta la teor{\'{i}}a y las limitaciones de este m{\'{e}}todo. El m{\'{e}}todo cl{\'{a}}sico SPH presenta una inestabilidad de tensi{\'{o}}n cuando se aplica a s{\'{o}}lidos. En las varias versionas del modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH, las ecuaciones del modelo matem{\'{a}}tico se discretizan en el tiempo bas{\'{a}}ndose en el m{\'{e}}todo Taylor-Galerkin. En una segunda etapa las ecuaciones se discretizan en el espacio con el m{\'{e}}todo SPH. La mezcla entre el SPH cl{\'{a}}sico y el m{\'{e}}todo Taylor-Galerkin permite evitar el desarrollo de la inestabilidad de tensi{\'{o}}n y en consecuencia el nuevo modelo se puede utilizar para modelizar el comportamiento dinamico de s{\'{o}}lidos. El c{\'{o}}digo num{\'{e}}rico propuesto en esta tesis ha sido probado con 17 casos. Los resultados obtenidos han sido comparados con soluciones anal{\'{i}}ticas cuando era posible y han mostrado que el modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH es exacto y es {\'{u}}til para predecir roturas localizadas en suelos secos y saturados.},

abstract = {A non-local theory is proposed to model dense granular flows. The idea is to describe the rearrangements occurring when a granular material is sheared as a self-activated process. A rearrangement at one position is triggered by the stress fluctuations induced by rearrangements elsewhere in the material. Within this framework, the constitutive law, which gives the relation between the shear rate and the stress distribution, is written as an integral over the entire flow. Taking into account the finite time of local rearrangements, the model is applicable from the quasi-static regime up to the inertial regime. We have checked the prediction of the model in two different configurations, namely granular flows down inclined planes and plane shear under gravity, and we show that many of the experimental observations are predicted within the self-activated model.},

abstract = {To understand the dynamic evolution of landslides and predict their physical extent, a computational model is required that is capable of analysing complex material behaviour as well as large strains and deformations. Here, a model is presented based on the so-called generalised-interpolation material-point method, combining a Eulerian grid for solving the governing equations of a continuum with a Lagrangian description for the material. The method is extended to analyse interaction between multiple bodies, introducing a master-slave algorithm for frictional contact along interfaces. Further, a deformed material description is introduced, based on time integration of the deformation gradient and utilising Gauss quadrature over the volume associated with each material point. The method has been implemented in a Fortran code and employed for the analysis of a landslide that took place during the night of December 1st, 2008, near L{\o}nstrup, Denmark. Using a simple Mohr-Coulomb model for the soil, the computational model is able to reproduce the change in the slope geometry at the site.},

Particular emphasis is placed on pioneering discretization methods for the solution of coupled non-linear problems at different length scales. The book, written by leading experts, reflects the remarkable advances that have been made in the field over the past decade and more, largely due to the development of a sound mathematical background and efficient computational strategies. The contents build upon the 2014 IUTAM symposium celebrating the 60th birthday of Professor Michael Ortiz, to whom this book is dedicated. His work has long been recognized as pioneering and is a continuing source of inspiration for many researchers.

Additionally, existing techniques for solids and fluids have difficulty producing convincing snow re- sults. Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this pa- per presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user- controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hy- brid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit in- tegration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character in- teractions.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional discrete and continuum modelling of excavator bucket filling is presented. The discrete element method (DEM) is used for the discrete modelling and the material-point method (MPM) for continuum modelling. MPM is a so-called particle method or meshless finite element method. Standard finite element methods have difficulty in modelling the entire bucket filling process due to large displacements and distortions of the mesh. The use of a meshless method overcomes this problem. DEM and MPM simulations (plane strain) of bucket filling are compared to two-dimensional experimental results. Cohesionless corn grains were used as material and the simulated force acting on the bucket and flow patterns were compared with experimental results. The corn macro (continuum) and micro (DEM) properties were obtained from shear and oedometer tests. As part of the MPM simulations, both the classic (nonpolar) and the Cosserat (polar) continuums were used. Results show that the nonpolar continuum is the most accurate in predicting the bucket force while the polar and DEM methods predict lower forces. The DEM model does not accurately predict the material flow during filling, while the polar and nonpolar methods are more accurate. Different flow zones develop during filling and it is shown that DEM, the polar and the nonpolar methods can accurately predict the position and orientation of these different flow zones. {\textcopyright} 2006 ISTVS.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a second-order projection method for the time-dependent, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. As in the original projection method developed by Chorin, we first solve diffusion-convection equations to predict intermediate velocities which are then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. By introducing more coupling between the diffusion-convection step and the projection step we obtain a temporal discretization that is second-order accurate. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized higher order Godunov method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at high Reynolds number. The Godunov procedure is second-order accurate for smooth flow and remains stable for discontinuous initial data, even in the zero-viscosity limit. We approximate the projection directly using a Galerkin procedure that uses a local basis for discretely divergence-free vector fields. Numerical results are presented validating the convergence properties of the method. We also apply the method to doubly periodic shear-layers to assess the performance of the method on more difficult applications.},

abstract = {This paper presents a depth-integrated model that can be used to simulate the flowslides, mudflows and debris flows that are caused by the failure of tailing dams, mining waste dumps and other similar structures. The sliding mass is first determined using a coupled elastoplastic finite element code and a suitable constitutive equation. Once failure has been triggered, propagation of the mobilised material is analysed considering flow properties averaged over depth. A simple law of pore pressure dissipation is postulated for cases in which the consolidation and propagation times are of the same order of magnitude.},

This paper presents a parallel computing strategy for the MPM with multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to boost the method's computational efficiency in large scale problems. Domain decomposition method is used to split the workload over subdomains onto a number of GPUs. Communication between the subdomains is implemented by the data transfer between GPUs and random access memory. On each GPU the MPM algorithm is parallelised over nodes or particles. Benchmark problems of slurry runout and surface pipe penetration are analysed to quantify the speedup of the multiple-GPU parallel simulations over the sequential counterparts on the central processing unit. The maximum speedup with 1 GPU is 84 and increases to ∼1280 using 16 GPUs.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) uses unconnected, Lagrangian, material points to discretize solids, fluids or membranes. All variables in the solution of the continuum equations are associated with these points; so, for example, they carry mass, velocity, stress and strain. A background Eulerian mesh is used to solve the momentum equation. Data mapped from the material points are used to initialize variables on the background mesh. In the case of multiple materials, the stress from each material contributes to forces at nearby mesh points, so the solution of the momentum equation includes all materials. The mesh solution then updates the material point values. This simple algorithm treats all materials in a uniform way, avoids complicated mesh construction and automatically applies a noslip contact algorithm at no additional cost. Several examples are used to demonstrate the method, including simulation of a pressurized membrane and the impact of a probe with a pre-inflated airbag.

abstract = {An extension of the Material Point Method [1] based on the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation (DG) [2] is presented here. A solid domain is represented by a collection of particles that can move and carry the fields of the problem inside an arbitrary computational grid in order to provide a Lagrangian description of the deformation without mesh tangling issues. The background mesh is then used as a support for the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation that leads to a weak form of conservation laws involving numerical fluxes defined at element faces. Those terms allow the introduction of the characteristic structure of hyperbolic problems within the numerical method by using an approximate Riemann solver [3]. The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method, which can be viewed as a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) with modified quadrature rule, aims at meeting advantages of both mesh-free and DG methods. The method is derived within the finite deformation framework for multidimensional problems by using a total Lagrangian formulation. A particular attention is paid to one specific discretization leading to a stability condition that allows to set the CFL number at one. The approach is illustrated and compared to existing or developed analytical solutions on one-dimensional problems and compared to the finite element method on two-dimensional simulations.},

abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) uses a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to solve problems involving large deformations. A problem domain is discretised as material points which are advected on a background grid. Problems are encountered with the original MPM when material points cross between grid cells, and this has been tackled by the development of the Generalised Interpolation MPM, where material points' domains of influence extend beyond the currently occupied grid cell. In this paper, the Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) Method has been implemented implicitly in a manner that allows a global stiffness matrix to be constructed similar to that in the Finite Element Method (FEM) by combining contributions from individual elements on the background grid. An updated Lagrangian finite deformation framework has been used to ensure non-linear behaviour within each of the loadsteps. The weighting functions used for this which make the GIMP method different to standard MPM are presented and the implementation is explained. Specific details on computing the deformation gradient to be consistent with the updated Lagrangian framework and the updating of the material point influence domains are outlined, both of which are currently unclear in the published literature. It is then shown through numerical examples that for both small and large deformation elastic and elasto-plastic problems, the implicit GIMP method agrees well with analytical solutions and exhibits convergence properties between that of linear and quadratic FEM.},

abstract = {Due to the high nonlinearities and extreme large deformation, the hypervelocity impact simulation is a challenging task for numerical methods. Meshfree particle methods, such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and material point method (MPM), are promising for the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems. In this paper, the material point method is applied to the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems, and a three-dimensional MPM computer code, MPM3D, is developed. The Johnson–Cook material model and Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state are implemented. Furthermore, the basic formulations of MPM are compared with SPH, and their performances are compared numerically by using MPM3D and LS-DYNA SPH module. This study shows that the material point method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the hypervelocity impact problems. MPM possesses many prominent features. The formulation of MPM is simple and similar to the traditional finite element method (FEM). Spatial derivatives are calculated based on a regular computational grid in MPM, so that the time consuming neighbor searching, which is compulsory in most meshfree methods, is not required. The approximation of field variables and their spatial derivatives is efficiently evaluated using the information of only 8 grid nodes in three-dimensional problem, and the shape functions exactly satisfy the constant and linear consistency. The boundary conditions can be applied in MPM as easily as in FEM, and contact algorithm can be efficiently implemented whose cost is linear in the number of bodies. Because the same regular computational grid can be used in all time steps, the time step size keeps constant in MPM simulation.},

abstract = {Risk associated with landslides of natural or man-made origin depends on the prediction of the post-failure behaviour of the mobilized mass. Numerical models capable of integrating the landslide geometry and its evolution, the coupled hydro mechanical interaction and the soil properties in the context of dynamic forces and large displacements are currently under development. This thesis is a contribution to this effort. In this sense, the material point method (MPM) is especially suited for analyzing landslides with large displacements. This numerical procedure must be accompanied by tests under controlled conditions in order to accurately check and calibrate the numerical response. In this thesis the capabilities of the MPM code developed are evaluated through the modelling of scaled laboratory slope tests with large displacements. In order to achieve an adequate comparison of the experimental and numerical results, the experiments are analysed by means of the interpretation of sequential digital images of the movement of the granular medium during the test (PIV technique). A novel procedure is developed to obtain the field of deformations over time and the tracking of particle path in a manner suitable for comparison with numerical results calculated in MPM. The main objective of the thesis was the development of a comprehensive calculation tool capable of simulating the behaviour of the slides from the initial triggering to the post-failure phase including thermal effects that determine the evolution of the movement. A formulation for non-isothermal problems coupled with hydraulic and mechanical behaviour in MPM was developed and implemented. The formulation includes the dissipation of frictional work as heat, which takes place, mainly, in shear bands. The described phenomena are strongly dependent on the thickness of the shear band and this result in a strong dependence of the numerical results in MPM with the discretization mesh. A novel procedure to solve this problem is presented in this thesis. Finally, very rapid Vajont landslide (Italy 1963) is modelled. A plain strain 2D model is presented without an “a priori” definition of the sliding surface. In fact, in a generalization of previous and recent work, the mobilized materials are not restricted to rigid solids interconnected along a predefined contact surface and the heat generation is not it is limited to a single predefined surface. Thus, thermal interaction processes are developed throughout the model as a function of the location and intensity of deformations.},

In this paper, various large-deformation analysis methods are introduced and their applicability for solving landslide problems is discussed. Since catastrophic landslides often involve seepage forces, consideration of the coupled behaviour of soil and pore fluid is essential. Two approaches to model soil–pore fluid coupling in large-deformation analysis using the material point method (MPM) are introduced. An example simulation is presented for each approach; one on a model levee failure and the other on a natural cut slope failure (the Selborne experiment conducted by Cooper and...},

The Disuete Element Method (DEM) is used for disrete modelling and the Material-Point Method (MPM) fo, continuum modelling. MPM is a so-called particle method or meshless fi-nite element method. Standard finite element meth-ods have dfficulty in modelling the complete dis-charge process unless remeshing is employed. The use of meshless methods overcomes this problem. Experiments are performed using a two-dimensional rectangular silo. Corn grains and ssnd are used as materials. A calibration process is proposed to de-termine the micro material properties needed for DEM simulations. The calibration process is based on experimental and numerical direct shear and compressions tests. Granular materials often exhibit rotational degrees of freedom associated with couple moments. To account for the rotation, the Cosserat polar continuum is used with MPM. DEM and MPM simulations are performed and the results of flow patterns and flow rates compared to experi-ments. It is concluded that both DEM and MPM can successfuUy model the total discharge process in terms of flow patterns and flow rates. A time study shows that if a relatively small number of particles are used in a DEM model, the computing times are comparable to that of MPM.},

abstract = {In this paper, a computational framework based on the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is developed to study the coupled behaviour of fluid and solid in a deformable porous medium. The mathematical framework developed herein is derived from the Biot's two-phase mixture theory in which the solid is modelled as an elasto-plastic material and the pore-fluid as an incompressible fluid. The key feature of the proposed numerical framework is that both solid and fluid phases are solved simultaneously in two different Lagrangian discretisations (or two different sets of Lagrangian particles) using their own governing equations that are linked through several laws of physics. The capability of the SPH method to model large deformation of the solid materials enables the framework to account for the permeability change due to the dilatant shear behaviour of the solid phase. To obtain a stable and accurate SPH solution for the pore-fluid, an incompressible SPH (ISPH) approach is adapted to correctly simulate the pore-pressure distribution of the fluid phase inside the porous medium. The proposed coupled SPH framework is firstly validated against analytical and solutions obtained using finite element method (FEM) for a submerged soil medium subjected to a gravitational load and a seepage flow through an elastic embankment, respectively. Then, it is employed for the simulation of flows through rockfill dams and an embankment failure induced by seepage flows. Simulation results predicted by SPH show very good agreements with analytical, FEM and experimental results. This suggests that the proposed two-phase SPH framework is a promising approach for future studies of coupled problems that involve complex water free-surface/seepage flows and large deformation of soils which are difficult to be modelled using traditional FEM-based coupled two-phase flow models.},

abstract = {The main objective of this work lies in the development of a variational implicit Material Point Method (MPM), implemented in the open source Kratos Multiphysics framework. The ability of the MPM technique to solve large displacement and large deformation problems is widely recognised and its use ranges over many problems in industrial and civil engineering. In the current work the continuum based implicit MPM is applied to engineering applications, where granular material flow is involved. For the resolution of the length and time scale of these particular problems, both continuum and discrete models are typically used. Even if discrete techniques predict more feasible results, nowadays, their use is limited to the investigation of element tests of particles, or to the simulation of reduced systems, not allowing to make important decisions in the analysis and design of granular processes. Some advantages of MPM over discrete methods are tested, such as, the ability to simulate granular flow at the large scale with acceptable computational cost and the capability to get information of stress and strain state in a more straightforward way. The focus of this paper is a comparative study between an irreducible and a mixed formulation, both implemented in the MPM code, to assess the improvement in accuracy and reliability of the numerical results when the latter formulation is adopted.},

abstract = {Semi-analytical wall boundary conditions present a mathematically rigorous framework to prescribe the influence of solid walls in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for fluid flows. In this paper they are investigated with respect to the skew-adjoint property which implies exact energy conservation. It will be shown that this property holds only in the limit of the continuous SPH approximation, whereas in the discrete SPH formulation it is only approximately true, leading to numerical noise. This noise, interpreted as a form of “turbulence”, is treated using an additional volume diffusion term in the continuity equation which we show is equivalent to an approximate Riemann solver. Subsequently two extensions to the boundary conditions are presented. The first dealing with a variable driving force when imposing a volume flux in a periodic flow and the second showing a generalization of the wall boundary condition to Robin type and arbitrary-order interpolation. Two modifications for free-surface flows are presented for the volume diffusion term as well as the wall boundary condition. In order to validate the theoretical constructs numerical experiments are performed showing that the present volume flux term yields results with an error 5 orders of magnitude smaller then previous methods while the Robin boundary conditions are imposed correctly with an error depending on the order of the approximation. Furthermore, the proposed modifications for free-surface flows improve the behavior at the intersection of free surface and wall as well as prevent free-surface detachment when using the volume diffusion term. Finally, this paper is concluded by a simulation of a dam break over a wedge demonstrating the improvements proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {The stability of a dense granular assembly can be greatly reduced by a pore pressure of the interstitial fluid, and the body may fail and transit from a solid-like state to a fluid-like state. This process involves two major problems: large deformation and hydro-mechanical coupling. In this work, a three-dimensional fully coupled hydro-mechanical model using material point method (MPM) is developed. Darcy's law, considering the inertial effect, is adopted to govern the motion of interstitial water, and the conservation of momentum of the mixture is used to govern the motion of the solid, i.e., granular materials. The spatial discretization schemes for these equations are derived using the generalized integration material point method (GIMP), and the proposed coupled MPM formulation is implemented in a three-dimensional numerical code. The developed model is first quantitatively validated by comparing the simulation results of temporal evolution of spatial distribution of hydraulic pressure in a one-dimensional oedometer test with the analytical results. An experiment is designed to observe the failure of a saturated sand pile, in which the partial-saturated region is avoided by increasing the hydraulic head at the input boundary, and the kinetic energy of water is dissipated by a filtering cloth. The failure process is simulated with the MPM code. It is found that the location of the shear band in the simulation agrees with the location of the sliding surface in the experiment. The temporal evolutions of the spatial distributions of hydraulic pressure and the solid velocity distribution at a specific time are given to provide insight into the mechanism of the failure process. This work would be helpful in understanding the initiation mechanism of debris flows induced by rainfall, and sand production in gas hydrate-bearing sediments due to increasing fluid content associated with hydrate dissociation.},

• la ecuaci{\'{o}}n de balance de momento de la fase del fluido intersticial y de la mezcla,
• la ecuaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva y
• una ecuaci{\'{o}}n cinem{\'{a}}tica.
Debido a sus propiedades geom{\'{e}}tricas, los deslizamientos de ladera se caracterizan por tener
una profundidad muy peque{\~{n}}a frente a su longitud y a su anchura, y, consecuentemente, el modelo
matem{\'{a}}tico mencionado anteriormente se puede simplificar integrando en profundidad las ecuaciones,
pasando de un modelo 3D a 2D, el cual presenta una combinaci{\'{o}}n excelente de precisi{\'{o}}n,
sencillez y costes computacionales.

cuenta la variaci{\'{o}}n de presi{\'{o}}n de poros debida a cambios de altura, de consolidaci{\'{o}}n vertical o de cambios en las tensiones totales.
Con respecto al comportamiento constitutivo, uno de los problemas principales al modelizar

Con el fin de validar el modelo matem{\'{a}}tico y num{\'{e}}rico se reproducen tanto ejemplos de referencia

The study developed in this thesis focuses on the modelling of landslides propagation with the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) meshless method which has the great advantage of allowing
to deal with large deformation problems by avoiding expensive remeshing operations as happens
for mesh methods such as, for example, the Finite Element Method. In this thesis, special attention
is given to the role played by rheology and pore water pressure during these natural hazards.
The mathematical framework used is based on the v - pw Biot-Zienkiewicz formulation, which
represents the behaviour, formulated in terms of soil skeleton velocity and pore water pressure, of
the mixture of solid particles and pore water in a saturated media. The governing equations are:
• the mass balance equation for the pore water phase,
• the momentum balance equation for the pore water phase and the mixture,
• the constitutive equation and
• a kinematic equation.
Landslides, due to their shape and geometrical properties, have small depths in comparison with
their length or width, therefore, the mathematical model aforementioned can then be simplified by
depth integrating the equations, switching from a 3D to a 2D model, which presents an excellent
combination of accuracy, computational costs and simplicity.
The proposed model differs from previous depth integrated models by including a sub-model able
to provide information on pore water pressure profiles at each computational step of the landslide's
propagation. In an effective way, the evolution of the pore water pressure profiles is numerically
solved through a set of 1D Finite Differences explicit scheme at each SPH node. This new approach
is able to take into account the variation of the pore water pressure due to changes of height, vertical
consolidation or changes of total stress.
Concerning the constitutive behaviour, one of the main issues when modelling fast landslides
is the difficulty to simulate with the same constitutive or rheological model the transition from
the triggering phase, where the landslide behaves like a solid, to the propagation phase, where the
landslide behaves in a fluid-like manner. In this work thesis, a new rheological model is proposed,
based on the Perzyna viscoplastic model, thinking of viscoplasticity as the key to close the gap
between the triggering and the propagation phase. In order to validate the mathematical model and the numerical approach, benchmarks and laboratory
experiments are reproduced and compared to analytical solutions when possible. Finally,
applications to real cases are studied, with particular attention paid to the Aberfan flowslide of
1966, showing how the mathematical model accurately and successfully simulate these kind of natural
hazards.},

The well-known (u-p) formulation is employed in order to simulate the saturated porous domain. An X-FEM Penalty algorithm is adopted to prevent the overlap of the fracture edges. Meanwhile, the large time increment method (LATIN) is utilized to remove the leak-off flow in the case of crack closure. Multiple crack growth pattern is determined by means of energy based stress functions for cohesive fractures. A computational algorithm is proposed for distribution of the fracturing fluid flow across existing discontinuities. Finally, several examples are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed formulation.},

The model, which is based on the FLIP-material point, particle-in-cell method, solves continuum constutitive models for each grain. Interactions between grains are calculated with a contact algorithm that forbids interpenetration, but allows separation and sliding and rolling with friction. The particle-in-cell method eliminates the need for a separate contact detection step. The use of a common rest frame in the contact model yields a linear scaling of the computational cost with the number of grains. The properties of the model are illustrated by numerical solutions of sliding and rolling contacts, and for granular materials by a shear calculation. The results of numerical calculations demonstrate that contacts are modeled accurately for smooth granules whose shape is resolved by the computations mesh.},

ABSTRACT The goal of this dissertation has been to develop a precise and effective methodology to achieve a numerical model that represents fluidified geomaterials, in order to simulate the propagation of fast debris flows along natural slopes and infrastructures. Thus, a model consisting of three components is presented. First, the mathematical model, a coupled non-linear formulation, integrated along the depth of the flow, following a pseudo-Lagrangian mode, in which the fundamental principles of conservation of mass and inertia of the flow. Second, the rheological model, that adds a mathematical expression to the previous system, in which the stresses and deformations of the flow are related. The following rheological laws have been implemented pure frictional, Voellmy, pure Bingham and Bingham with evolution. Third, the numerical model, which performs the integration of the system of first order differential equations in order to obtain the movement of the flow along time and space. The system is formed by the mathematical model and the rheological model. The outline of the solution is based in a gridless Lagrangian method known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH). The methodology has been validated by reproducing three types of problems: problem sets with known theoretical solutions, laboratory tests performed under controlled conditions and several real events using back-analysis. The first problem set was the analysis of a dam failure. This problem was reproduced with excellent precision, avoiding oscillations or other distortions, thus confirming the numerical stability of SPH. In the second set, the flow of dry sand along a sloped channel with irregular bottom was simulated, using the data available from to experimental tests performed at USGS (Iverson et al. 2004). The results conform very well to the behaviour observed in the laboratory, since the shape, extents and thickness of the material in the simulation agree with the laboratory measurements. Thirdly, three cases of debris flows that happened in Hong Kong were simulated: Fei Tsui and Shun Wan, in august of 1995, and Lo Way in august of 2005. As before, the results of the simulations agreed satisfactorily with real data. These results prove that the equations adequately describe the physical phenomena, and that the proposed SPH numerical method, integrated along the depth of the flow, suitably solves the system of differential equations. This SPH model allows the simulation of fundamental aspects of the problem, allowing its use in situations such as risk zoning prevention and mitigation measures both in the short and long terms, particularly since it can estimate the speed, length, thickness and extension of the flows.},

abstract = {Includes index. The areas of suspension mechanics, stability and computational rheology have exploded in scope and substance in the last decade. The present book is one of the first of a comprehensive nature to treat these topics in detail. The aim of the authors has been to highlight the major discoveries and to present a number of them in sufficient breadth and depth so that the novice can learn from the examples chosen, and the expert can use them as a reference when necessary. The first two chapters, grouped under the category {\textless}IT{\textgreater}General Principles{\textless}/IT{\textgreater}, deal with the kinematics of continuous media and the balance laws of mechanics, including the existence of the stress tensor and extensions of the laws of vector analysis to domains bounded by fractal curves or surfaces. The third and fourth chapters, under the heading {\textless}IT{\textgreater}Constitutive Modelling{\textless}/IT{\textgreater}, present the tools necessary to formulate constitutive equations from the continuum or the microstructural approach. The last three chapters, under the caption {\textless}IT{\textgreater}Analytical and Numerical Techniques{\textless}/IT{\textgreater}, contain most of the important results in the domain of the fluid mechanics of viscoelasticity, and form the core of the book. A number of topics of interest have not yet been developed to a theoretical level from which applications can be made in a routine manner. However, the authors have included these topics to make the reader aware of the state of affairs so that research into these matters can be carried out. For example, the sections which deal with domains bounded by fractal curves or surfaces show that the existence of a stress tensor in such regions is still open to question. Similarly, the constitutive modelling of suspensions, especially at high volume concentrations, with the corresponding particle migration from high to low shear regions is still very sketchy.

For the small-strain problem of a vibrating bar, the best results are obtained using quadratic elements. It is shown that for more complex problems, the use of partially negative shape functions is inconsistent with the material-point method in its current form, necessitating other types of interpolation such as cubic splines in order to obtain smoother representations of field quantities.

abstract = {Finite elements used for analysis of plastic failure must admit near incompressible behaviour for meaningful results whenever the plastic flow rule is isochoric. Most of the classical elements based on displacement formulations present problems to a greater or lesser extent when obtaining limit loads and failure mechanisms. Mixed pressure-displacement formulations are a suitable alternative, but not every combination of interpolation functions for pressures and displacements is allowed, since they have to satisfy Babu{\v{s}}ka-Brezzi conditions or pass a patch test for convergence. This excludes interpolations of the same order for both fields unless special techniques are used. This paper describes the formulation of mixed displacement-pressure elements with the same order of interpolation, and presents application to elastic and contained viscoplastic failure problems. It is shown how such different elements, like the T3P3 (linear displacements and pressures triangle) or the T6P6 (quadratic triangle in both variables), avoid volumetric locking and circumvent above mentioned restrictions. Indeed the formulation allows arbitrary interpolations as all restrictions are removed. However, the proposed formulation does not improve other aspects of element behaviour such as bending, and, therefore, the linear triangle is not recommended. Finally, performance of the quadratic T6P6 triangle is assessed using boundary value problems for which analytical solutions are available. Robustness against distortion is checked, and a good overall performance of this element is found. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the rapid fluid-like flow of a finite mass of granular material down a chute with partial lateral confinement. The chute consists of a section inclined at 40° to the horizontal, which is connected to a plane run-out zone by a smooth transition. The flow is confined on the inclined section by a shallow parabolic cross-slope profile. Photogrammetric techniques have been used to determine the position of the evolving boundary during the flow, and the free-surface height of the stationary granular deposit in the run-out zone. The results of three experiments with different granular materials are presented and shown to be in very good agreement with numerical simulations based on the Savage–Hutter theory for granular avalanches. The basal topography over which the avalanche flows has a strong channelizing effect on the inclined section of the chute. As the avalanche reaches the run-out zone, where the lateral confinement ceases, the head spreads out to give the avalanche a characteristic ‘tadpole' shape. Sharp gradients in the avalanche thickness and velocity began to develop at the interface between the nose and tail of the avalanche as it came to rest, indicating that a shock wave develops close to the end of the experiments.},

abstract = {During the installation of displacement piles the soil around the pile is heavily distorted, which involves large shear deformation especially along the pile shaft and compression especially around the pile tip. This leads to a change of the stress and density state and therefore also to the soil behaviour in the adjacent area around the pile and has a significant influence on the pile bearing capacity. In general, numerical simulations of displacement piles with the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) cannot account for installation effects due to significant mesh distortion. Using the Material Point Method (MPM), however, shortcomings due to the occurring large deformations can be circumvented. In this method (Lagrangian) material points carrying the state parameters move through a (Eulerian) background mesh atwhich the equations of motion are solved. In the current paperMPMsimulations of the installation of a displacement pile in Baskarp sand using a Mohr-Coulomb model are presented. The numerical results are compared with centrifuge tests at 40g. The comparison indicates that MPM is well suited to simulate the installation process of displacement piles as well as subsequent load tests in granular soil.},

Recently, MPM has been successfully applied in many engineering applications including solid and solid–fluid interaction problems due to its capability to model complex history dependent material behaviours. However, the conventional explicit MPM approach exhibits numerical limitations in incompressible or near incompressible material behaviour problems. We study an implicit treatment of the pressure in MPM algorithm to simulate material incompressibility avoiding artificial pressure oscillations and significantly small time steps present in the explicit MPM approach. Applying Chorin's projection method to the velocity–pressure coupled equations, an elliptic equation is solved for the pressure which is then used to solve the divergence free velocity field. The results of dam break problem show no spurious pressure oscillations and large time steps compared to the traditional explicit MPM. The ability of the present implicit MPM formulation to model incompressible materials will be an additional advantage in simulating materials with complex constitutive equations which exhibit a time dependent memory.},

abstract = {The flow of granular solids within rigid walls is modeled using continuum mechanics. The problem is represented as a viscoplastic flow in which the discontinuity function is taken as in previous works by Gray and Stiles, while the flow rule is modeled by the von-Mises criterion. The resulting model is incompressible and based on non-associated viscoplasticity. The apparent viscosity results in a non-linear function of the second invariant of the symmetric rate of deformation tensor and of the pressure. Friction, cohesion and fluidity of the granular model are taken into account. The constitutive model has been implemented assuming steady-state, in which the granular material flows under a critical state (incompressible behavior). Discretization of the problem has been carried out by finite elements, with direct iteration techniques to solve the non-linear system of equations. The model has been applied to the massive flow of granular material stored in vertical silos and hoppers with axisymmetric or planar shape. Comparisons with experimental tests performed by other authors are presented, together with parametric investigations to identify the main variables affecting the response.},

MPM is a so-called meshless method capable of modelling large displacements, deformations and contact between different bodies. A short introduction to MPM is given and the derivation of the discrete governing equations. The analysis of a vertically loaded anchor and one loaded at 458 is presented. The load– displacement curves are compared to that obtained from experiments and the effect of soil stiffness and anchor roughness is investigated. The results of the vertically loaded anchor are also compared to an analytical solution. The displacement of the soil surface above the anchor was measured and compared to the numerical predictions. Convergence with mesh refinement is demonstrated and the effect of mesh size and dilatancy angle on the shear band width and orientation is indicated. The results show that MPM can model anchor pull out successfully. No special interface elements are needed to model the anchor–soil interface and the predicted ultimate capacities were within 10{\%} of the measured values.},

The first is due to the components of the stiffness matrix (or other matrices) being derived by performing numerical integration using the material points, and the second is due to calculating the strain from the nodal displacements of the elements, interpolated to the material points, via the shape function spatial derivatives. In this paper, an improvement for the recovery of results from the nodes to the material points is presented, where an increase of the Cn continuity along with an interpolation involving nodes from neighbouring elements is applied.},

During this process, an apparent erosion is observed and the thickness of the flowing layer increases. We precisely study the evolution of the vertical velocity profile in this transient regime.

abstract = {In the present work, the energy conservation properties of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are investigated in the presence of fluid–solid interactions. Similarly to the fluid phase, the solid bodies are modeled through solid particles so that the whole solid–fluid domain can be described as a unique particle system. The pressure and velocity fields are, then, extended over the solid particles in different ways, taking into account consistency issues related to the SPH differential operators and using the projection of the Navier–Stokes equations on the solid boundary. It is shown that, when solid particles are considered, the energy equation of the particle system contains some extra terms that depend on the pressure–velocity field extensions. The presence of these extra terms does not affect the consistency of the SPH model, since they tend to vanish when the spatial resolution is increased. Three prototypical numerical test cases are considered in order to provide a quantitative perspective of the matter and confirm the theoretical developments of the paper. These test cases show that the nature of these terms is globally dissipative, being thus in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In particular, the viscous extra term displays a remarkably slow rate of convergence, this being a relevant outcome for those SPH practitioners that deal with these types of flows.},

abstract = {Contact between bodies is one of the most challenging problems to solve, especially when combined with large deformations. For MPM, several methods have been developed to simulate frictional contact, i.e. shear stress is proportional to the normal stress via a friction coefficient; however, for cohesive soils under undrained conditions the interface shear stress is more likely a function of the undrained shear strength and independent of the normal stress (adhesive contact). This paper presents the extension of one of the most widely used contact algorithms in MPM for adhesive contact. This enhanced formulation is validated with a sliding block benchmark and applied to the simulation of cone penetration testing (CPT) in clay. CPT is an in situ test commonly used in geoengineering to determine the subsoil's stratigraphy and to estimate soil parameters. It is shown that the adhesion at the cone-soil interface affects significantly the measured cone resistance. Numerical results are compared with available analytical and experimental studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method to describe undrained penetration in clay.},

abstract = {The solution of gravity-driven free surface flows typically resorts to the Shallow Water Equations, SWE. In turn, the derivation of the SWE incorporates a number of assumptions and within them, it should be stressed that of quasi-horizontal fluid velocities. However, when the flow occurs onto a steep and curved topography, the velocities are parallel to the bed rather than horizontal and curvature effects may affect the fluid flow. This paper extends the SWE incorporating the inclined and curved bed effects thus, allowing the analysis of gravity flows on actual topographies. Due to the similarity between the generalized and the standard SWE, the numerical methods available for the solution of the SWE can be easily applied for the solution of the generalized equations. Within these methods, this paper uses the Taylor-Galerkin algorithm. The results obtained in the numerical test cases indicate that incorporating the slope and curvature effects in the model is relevant for granular flows and of reduced effect in the remaining cases. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

An improved one for three-dimensional material point method is presented in this paper. The improved algorithm emphasizes the energy conservation of the system and faithfully recovers opposite acting forces between contacting bodies. Contrasted to the one by Bardenhagen, both the normal and tangential contacting forces are more appropriately applied to the contacting bodies via the contacting nodes of the background mesh; Contrasted to the one by Hu and Chen, not only the tangential velocities but also the normal ones are handled separately in respective individual mesh. This treatment ensures not only the contact/sliding/separation procedure but also the friction between contacting bodies are recovered. The presented contact algorithm is validated via numerical experiments including rolling simulation, impact of elastic spheres, impact of a Taylor bar and impact of plastic spheres. The numerical results show that the multi-mesh material point method with the improved contact algorithm is more suitable for solving collision problems.},

abstract = {Internal erosion is a general term referring to the mechanism of detachment and movement of soil grains due to water flow through a porous media. It includes many different processes such as piping, soil contact erosion, or suffusion. The study and prediction of these complex phenomena is a recurrent topic in many different fields such as geotechnics, hydraulic and hydrocarbon engineering. This is because internal erosion is one of the main causes of failure of water retaining structures such as dikes and dams. This process also controls the amount of sand production in oil-producing wells. In many cases, such instabilities are related to large deformation of the material involved. The goal of this study is to present a first approach using the Material Point Method to model internal erosion process that occurs in bimodal internally unstable soils. These type of soils consist of a mixture of coarse and fine grains, in which the coarse fraction forms the stable skeleton of the soil, whilst fine grains can be eroded and are able to move freely as a result of seepage flow. The results of a simple numerical test consisting of a soil column subjected to a vertical flow of water are presented. It can be seen that fine fraction is eroded from the solid skeleton depending on the erosion law, and it transported as fluidised material through the saturated porous media.},

While these large complex problems lead to some impressive simulations and solutions, there has been a lack of basic analysis characterizing the errors present in the method, even on the simplest of problems. The large number of choices one has when implementing the method, such as the choice of basis functions and boundary treatments, further complicates this error analysis. In this paper we explore some of the many choices one can make when implementing an MPM algorithm and the numerical ramiﬁcations of these choices. Speciﬁcally, we analyze and demonstrate how the smoothing length within the Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method (GIMP) can affect the error and stability properties of the method. We also demonstrate how various choices of basis functions and boundary treatments affect the spatial convergence properties of MPM.},

abstract = {Using a simple one-dimensional shock problem as an example, the present paper investigates numerical properties of the original material point method (MPM), the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method, the convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) method, and the dual domain material point (DDMP) method. For a weak isothermal shock of ideal gas, the MPM cannot be used with accuracy. With a small number of particles per cell, GIMP and CPDI produce reasonable results. However, as the number of particles increases the methods fail to converge and produce pressure spikes. The DDMP method behaves in an opposite way. With a small number of particles per cell, DDMP results are unsatisfactory. As the number of particles increases, the DDMP results converge to correct solutions, but the large number of particles needed for convergence makes the method very expensive to use in these types of shock wave problems in two- or three-dimensional cases. The cause for producing the unsatisfactory DDMP results is identified. A simple improvement to the method is introduced by using sub-points. With this improvement, the DDMP method produces high quality numerical solutions with a very small number of particles. Although in the present paper, the numerical examples are one-dimensional, all derivations are for multidimensional problems. With the technique of approximately tracking particle domains of CPDI, the extension of this sub-point method to multidimensional problems is straightforward. This new method preserves the conservation properties of the DDMP method, which conserves mass and momentum exactly and conserves energy to the second order in both spatial and temporal discretizations.},

abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) has become the standard tool for the analysis of a wide range of solid mechanics problems. However, the underlying structure of a classical updated Lagrangian FEM is not well suited for the treatment of large deformation problems, since excessive mesh distortions can lead to numerical difficulties. The Material Point Method (MPM) represents an approach in which material points moving through a fixed finite element grid are used to simulate large deformations. As the method makes use of moving material points, it can also be classified as a point-based or meshless method. With no mesh distor- tions, it is an ideal tool for the analysis of large deformation problems. MPM has its origin in fluid mechanics and has only recently been applied to solid mechanics problems. It has been used successfully for impact analyses where bodies penetrate each other and for silo discharging problems. All existing MPM codes found in literature are dynamic codes with explicit time integration and only recently implicit time integration. In this study a quasi-static MPM formulation and implementation are presented. The paper starts with the de- scription of the quasi-static governing equations and the numerical discretisation. Afterwards, the calculation process of the quasi-static MPM is explained, followed by the presentation of benchmark problems which have been calculated with the newly developed quasi-static MPM code. The benchmark problems consist of the oedometer test and large elastic bending of a cantilever beam. For validation, the results are compared with analytical solutions and FEM results.},

abstract = {Based on the u-p form governing equations and the convected particle domain interpolation technique, the improved convected particle domain interpolation based material point method (CCPDI) is developed in this paper for the coupled dynamic and contact analysis of fully saturated porous media involving large deformation. The numerical artifact noises due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries that usually occur in large deformation are eliminated by using the smoother interpolation functions presented in the convected particle domain interpolation technique. The discrete equations are derived in the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method. The boundary load tracking algorithm and a modified contact algorithm are proposed based on the definition of particle domains to apply accurately the surface loads on the motive boundaries and to capture correctly the contact time/behaviors in large deformation problems, respectively. Simulations of several representative one- and two-dimensional problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Compared to those obtained by using the coupling material point method and/or finite element method, the simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCPDI method can be successfully used in simulating the large deformation coupled dynamic responses of the solid skeleton and fluid phase in fully saturated porous media and the large deformation impact between solid and saturated porous bodies.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) is a version of the particle-in-cell (PIC) which has substantial advantages over pure Lagrangian or Eulerian methods in numerical simulations of problems involving large deformations. The MPM helps to avoid mesh distortion and tangling problems related to Lagrangian methods and as well as the advection errors associated with Eulerian methods. Despite the MPM being promoted for its ability to solve large deformation problems the method suffers from instabilities when material points cross between elements. These instabilities are due to the lack of smoothness of the grid basis functions used for mapping information between the material points and the background grid. In this paper a novel high-order MPM is developed to eliminate the cell-crossing instability and improve the accuracy of the MPM method.},

abstract = {The entrainment of channel-path material plays an important role during runout of many rapid landslides. Such a mechanism is able to change the mobility of a flow significantly, through rapid changes of the flow volume and rheology. The purpose of this paper is to use mathematical, rheological and constitutive models to analyse the entrainment effect on runout analysis results. After a brief review and classification of some well-established erosion laws, a simple, yet effective, empirical formula for the entrainment rate has been selected, and is implemented in a continuum mechanics-based numerical model. First, some hypothetical examples are used to test the effectiveness of the implemented entrainment process, and to evidence the respective role of entrainment and topography on a flow propagation. Then a back-analysis is presented of the 2000 Tsing Shan event (Hong Kong), where a small volume of 150 m3 of material grew to 1620 m3 because of the strong erosion along the slope.

General mathematical expressions for the terms of the set of governing equations are given. A suction-dependent elastoplastic Mohr–Coulomb model, expressed in terms of net stress and suction variables is implemented. The instability of a slope subjected to rain infiltration, inspired from a real case, is solved and discussed. The model shows the development of the initial failure surface in a region of deviatoric strain localisation, the evolution of stress and suction states in some characteristic locations, the progressive large strain deformation of the slope and the dynamics of the motion characterised by the history of displacement, velocity and acceleration of the unstable mass.},

abstract = {A numerical scheme of computing quantities involving gradients of shape functions is introduced for the material point method (MPM), so that the quantities are continuous as material points move across cell boundaries. The noise and instability caused by cell crossing of the material points are then eliminated. In this scheme, the formulas used to compute these quantities can be expressed in the same forms as in the original material point method, but with the gradient of the shape function modified. For one-dimensional cases, the gradient of the shape function used in the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method is a special case of the modified gradient if the characteristic function of a material point is introduced. The characteristic function of a material point is not otherwise needed in this scheme, therefore difficulties in tracking its evolution are avoided. Although the support of the modified gradient of a shape function is enlarged from the cell containing the material point to also include the immediate neighbor cells, all the non-local effects of a material point can be accounted for by two consecutive local operations. Therefore this scheme can be used in calculations with unstructured grids. This scheme is proved to satisfy mass and momentum conservations exactly. The error in energy conservation is shown to be second order on both spatial and temporal discretizations. Although the error in energy conservation is the same order as that in the original material point method, numerical examples show that this scheme has significantly better energy conservation properties than those of the original material point method.},

abstract = {While particle-in-cell type methods, such as MPM, have been very successful in providing solutions to many challenging problems there are some important issues that remain to be resolved with regard to their analysis. One such challenge relates to the difference in dimensionality between the particles and the grid points to which they are mapped. There exists a non-trivial null space of the linear operator that maps particles values onto nodal values. In other words, there are non-zero particle values values that when mapped to the nodes are zero there. Given positive mapping weights such null space values are oscillatory in nature. The null space may be viewed as a more general form of the ringing instability identified by Brackbill for PIC methods. It will be shown that it is possible to remove these null-space values from the solution and so to improve the accuracy of PIC methods, using a matrix SVD approach. The expense of doing this is prohibitive for real problems and so a local method is developed for doing this.},

abstract = {Landslides can cause major economic damage and a large number of casualties as it is possible to see from past events occurred all over the world. Being able to predict these kind of hazards would then suppose the achievement of great benefits. Here a model that combines a depth integrated description of the soil-pore fluid mixture together with a set of 1D models dealing with pore pressure evolution within the soil mass is presented. The mathematical model is based on the Biot-Zienkiewicz equations, from where a depth averaged model is derived. Concerning the material behaviour, the approach used is the one suggested by the Perzyna viscoplasticity, which has been extensively used in the past to model solid behaviour prior to failure. In this framework, a simple shear rheological model is derived, providing the basal friction needed in depth integrated models. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been the numerical technique chosen to spatially discretised the depth integrated equations of the mathematical model. The purpose of this work is to apply the SPH depth integrated numerical model, together with the sub-model that predicts the evolution of the pore water pressure inside the landslide, to simulate the propagation phase of the Aberfan flowslide occurred in 1966.},

abstract = {The incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) method with projection-based pressure correction has been shown to be highly accurate and stable for internal flows and, importantly for many problems, the pressure field is virtually noise-free in contrast to the weakly compressible SPH approach (Xu et al., 2009 [31]). However for almost inviscid fluids instabilities at the free surface occur due to errors associated with the truncated kernels. A new algorithm is presented which remedies this issue, giving stable and accurate solutions to both internal and free-surface flows. Generalising the particle shifting approach of Xu et al. (2009) [31], the algorithm is based upon Fick's law of diffusion and shifts particles in a manner that prevents highly anisotropic distributions and the onset of numerical instability. The algorithm is validated against analytical solutions for an internal flow at higher Reynolds numbers than previously, the flow due to an impulsively started plate and highly accurate solutions for wet bed dam break problems at zero and small times. The method is then validated for progressive regular waves with paddle motion defined by linear theory. The accurate predictions demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in stabilising solutions and minimising the surface instabilities generated by the inevitable errors associated with truncated kernels. The test cases are thought to provide a more thorough quantitative validation than previously undertaken.},

abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) has become the stan-dard tool for the analysis of a wide range of solid mechanics problems. However, the underlying structure of a classical updated Lagrangian FEM is not well suited for the treatment of large deformation problems, since excessive mesh distortions can lead to numerical difficulties. The Material Point Method (MPM) represents an approach in which material points moving through a fixed finite element grid are used to simulate large de-formations. As the method makes use of moving material points, it can also be classified as a point-based or meshless method. With no mesh distortions, it is an ideal tool for the analysis of large deformation prob-lems. MPM has its origin in fluid mechanics and has only recently been applied to solid mechanics problems. It has been used successfully for im-pact analyses where bodies penetrate each other and for silo discharging problems. All existing MPM codes found in literature are dynamic codes with explicit time integration and only recently implicit time integra-tion. In this study a quasi-static MPM formulation and implementation are presented. The paper starts with the description of the quasi-static governing equations and the numerical discretisation. Afterwards, the calculation process of the quasi-static MPM is explained, followed by the presentation of some geotechnical boundary value problems which have been solved with the newly developed quasi-static MPM code. The bench-mark problems consist of an oedometer test and a slope. For validation, the results are compared with analytical solutions and FEM results, re-spectively.},

abstract = {Material point methods suffer from volumetric locking when modelling near incompressible materials due to the combination of a low-order computational mesh and large numbers of material points per element. However, large numbers of material points per element are required to reduce integration errors due to non-optimum placement of integration points. This restricts the ability of current material point methods in modelling realistic material behaviour. This paper presents for the first time a method to overcome finite deformation volumetric locking in standard and generalised interpolation material point methods for near-incompressible non-linear solid mechanics. The method does not place any restriction on the form of constitutive model used and is straightforward to implement into existing implicit material point method codes. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a number of two and three-dimensional examples and its correct implementation confirmed through convergence studies towards analytical solutions and by obtaining the correct order of convergence within the global Newton–Raphson equilibrium iterations. In particular, the proposed formulation has been shown to remove the over-stiff volumetric behaviour of conventional material point methods and reduce stress oscillations.

It is worthy of stressing that the RBF inter- polation has the merit of high smoothness and is very accurate and can easily be applied to theMPMframework for mapping information between moving particles, known as material point in the MPM, and background grids. The RBF-basedMPM is designed to overcome the unphysical results, such as shear stress distribution of the cantilever beam, in the traditional MPM with linear shape function. This study chooses the Mutiquadric (MQ) function as the RBF. The present strategy is tested to the benchmark cantilever beam and the circular disk impact problems. Numeri- cal results are observed in good agreement with the analytical solutions and satisfy the conservation of energy.},

Conventional mesh-based methods such as the finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM), are limited in simulation of the explosive welding when mesh distortion and interaction of different materials occur. In order to describe process of the explosive welding and accurately predict physical parameters for the explosive welding, numerical simulation of the explosive welding which involves multi-physical phenomenon is performed by using material point method (MPM). Not only can major physical phenomena of explosion impact be well captured, but also some important technical parameters for the explosive welding can be attained based on the MPM simulation. Through the comparison with the experimental results, it is shown that the MPM is a robust tool in simulation of the explosive welding.},

This paper analyzes this response on the basis of continuum mechanical descriptions of the problem. Three objective stress rates are recalled and spatial descriptions of plasticity at finite deformation are reviewed for the usual generalization of the infinitesimal theory as well as a theory based on an invariant measure of true stress. In light of the equations for the evolution of the yield surface, the hypoelastic solution to the simple shear problem for each of the three stress rates is presented. It is shown that the use of the Jaumann rate in the generalization of the infinitesimal theory leads to an oscillation in the evolution of the yield surface in simple shear which is explained on the basis of the hypoelastic solution. An alternative theory which makes use of the polar decomposition predicts a monotonically increasing shear stress. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, OWZ. The material point method (MPM) has been very successful in providing solutions to many challenging problems involving large deformations. Nevertheless there are some important issues that remain to be resolved with regard to its analysis. One key challenge applies to both MPM and particle-in-cell (PIC) methods and arises from the difference between the number of particles and the number of the nodal grid points to which the particles are mapped. This difference between the number of particles and the number of grid points gives rise to a non-trivial null space of the linear operator that maps particle values onto nodal grid point values. In other words, there are non-zero particle values that when mapped to the grid point nodes result in a zero value there. Moreover, when the nodal values at the grid points are mapped back to particles, part of those particle values may be in that same null space. Given positive mapping weights from particles to nodes such null space values are oscillatory in nature. While this problem has been observed almost since the beginning of PIC methods there are still elements of it that are problematical today as well as methods that transcend it. The null space may be viewed as being connected to the ringing instability identified by Brackbill for PIC methods. It will be shown that it is possible to remove these null space values from the solution using a null space filter. This filter improves the accuracy of the MPM methods using an approach that is based upon a local singular value decomposition (SVD) calculation. This local SVD approach is compared against the global SVD approach previously considered by the authors and to a recent MPM method by Zhang and colleagues.},

El M{\'{e}}todo del Punto Material {\'{o}} MPM (Sulsky et al. 1994, Sulsky et al. 1996) combina ventajas del m{\'{e}}todo de los elementos finitos y de los m{\'{e}}todos de part{\'{i}}culas. Podr{\'{i}}a describirse como una extensi{\'{o}}n del m{\'{e}}todo de los elementos finitos en el que se utiliza una malla para resolver las ecuaciones de gobierno, mientras que el continuo {\'{o}} el material se representan mediante "puntos materiales" {\'{o}} "part{\'{i}}culas" langrangianas de masa fija. En el MPM la informaci{\'{o}}n que transportan las part{\'{i}}culas: cantidad de movimiento, tensi{\'{o}}n, deformaci{\'{o}}n etc. se "proyecta" en la malla para cada paso de la soluci{\'{o}}n. Esta cubre {\'{i}}ntegramente el dominio del problema y en ella se imponen las condiciones de contorno. Luego de resolver en la malla las formas discretas de las ecuaciones de gobierno, se actualiza la posici{\'{o}}n de las part{\'{i}}culas y la informaci{\'{o}}n que transportan. As{\'{i}}, al final de cada paso, la malla puede descartarse porque toda la informaci{\'{o}}n la transportan las part{\'{i}}culas. Se evitan al mismo tiempo la distorsi{\'{o}}n de la malla para grandes desplazamientos (mesh tangling) y los problemas de convecci{\'{o}}n. El m{\'{e}}todo se adapta especialmente a problemas din{\'{a}}micos de grandes desplazamientos y deformaciones finitas e incorpora en forma natural un algoritmo de contacto sin deslizamiento que facilita su utilizaci{\'{o}}n en problemas de interacci{\'{o}}n entre s{\'{o}}lidos. El an{\'{a}}lisis de problemas geot{\'{e}}cnicos hidromec{\'{a}}nicos utilizando el MPM requiere del desarrollo de algoritmos para resolver el acoplamiento entre el esqueleto de suelo y las fases agua y/o aire y de la regularizaci{\'{o}}n del problema de localizaci{\'{o}}n de deformaciones para evitar que las soluciones dependan en forma patol{\'{o}}gica de la malla, que en el caso del MPM es una malla "soporte". En este trabajo se ha desarrollado un algoritmo expl{\'{i}}cito, en el marco del M{\'{e}}todo del Punto Material, que resuelve el problema acoplado presi{\'{o}}n de poros-desplazamiento. Adem{\'{a}}s se ha adaptado al MPM un procedimiento num{\'{e}}rico para la introducci{\'{o}}n de discontinuidades fuertes en la malla soporte (Wells et al. 2001, Wells et al. 2002). Se ha continuado con el desarrollo del c{\'{o}}digo Geopart (Zabala et al, 2004) que utiliza una versi{\'{o}}n expl{\'{i}}cita del MPM con un algoritmo incrementalmente objetivo para deformaciones finitas que incluye: construcci{\'{o}}n, an{\'{a}}lisis acoplado presi{\'{o}}n-desplazamiento en tensiones efectivas y modelos constitutivos sencillos. En general el colapso de presas de materiales sueltos es inadmisible. Las presas utilizadas para almacenar agua se ubican en muchos casos, aguas arriba de ciudades importantes, en zonas donde la amenaza s{\'{i}}smica puede ser muy alta. Por otro lado el porcentaje mayor de los colapsos ocurridos en el mundo corresponde a los de presas de residuos mineros. En particular el colapso de la presa de residuos mineros de Aznalc{\'{o}}llar, (Alonso et al. 2006, Alonso et al. 2006, Gens et al. 2006) que se toma en esta tesis como caso de estudio, caus{\'{o}} un da{\~{n}}o ambiental muy importante.

La simulaci{\'{o}}n y explicaci{\'{o}}n del mecanismo de colapso observado en Aznalcollar no es trivial. Se ha modelado la construcci{\'{o}}n de la presa y el proceso de su falla progresiva hasta el colapso.

abstract = {The particle-in-cell method (PIC), especially the latest version of it, the material point method (MPM), has shown significant advantage over the pure Lagrangian method or the pure Eulerian method in numerical simulations of problems involving large deformations. It avoids the mesh distortion and tangling issues associated with Lagrangian methods and the advection errors associated with Eulerian methods. Its application to multiphase flows or multi-material deformations, however, encounters a numerical difficulty of satisfying continuity requirement due to the inconsistence of the interpolation schemes used for different phases. It is shown in Section 3 that current methods of enforcing this requirement either leads to erroneous results or can cause significant accumulation of errors. In the present paper, a different numerical method is introduced to ensure that the continuity requirement is satisfied with an error consistent with the discretization error and will not grow beyond that during the time advancement in the calculation. This method is independent of physical models. Its numerical implementation is quite similar to the common method used in Eulerian calculations of multiphase flows. Examples calculated using this method are presented.},

In the proposed strategy, the dynamic analysis of saturated soil and solid bodies is handled by the CMPM and the original MPM respectively. The interaction between saturated soil and solid bodies is simulated by a new contact algorithm which effectively avoids the interpenetration between saturated soil and solid bodies. The proposed approach circumvents the difficulties associated with the conventional spatial discretization methods such as the finite element method in simulating the contact/impact behavior between saturated soil and solid bodies.

Nevertheless there are many open questions regarding the theoretical properties of MPM. For example in while Fourier methods, as applied to PIC may provide useful insight, the non-linear nature of MPM makes it necessary to use a full non-linear stability analysis to determine a stable time step for MPM. In order to begin to address this the stability analysis of Spigler and Vianello is adapted to MPM and used to derive a stable time step bound for a model problem. This bound is contrasted against traditional Speed of sound and CFL bounds and shown to be a realistic stability bound for a model problem.},

This approach, proposed 30 years ago for overconsolidated clays, had a tremendous advantage of treating a shear band evolution as a true physical process and not just as a sufficient mathematical condition for its existence. Extension of this approach to a wider variety of soils requires for non-elastic soil properties (e.g. isotropic hardening plasticity, strain softening, lack of tensile strength, dilatancy, active and passive failure modes, etc.) to be taken into account. This paper demonstrates how the energy balance and process zone approaches can be applied to the simple problem of the shallow shear band propagation in an infinite slope built of such a soil. The energy balance approach appears to be the most conservative one. It allows for catastrophic and progressive types of soil failure to be properly identified, and dramatically effects the results of the slope stability analysis.},

At Durham, a numerical modelling framework based on the material point method (MPM) is being developed for the installation phase of a screwpile. The aim is to use the model to provide an accurate representation of the in situ ground conditions once the pile is installed, as during installation the ground is disturbed and any model that “wishes in place” a screwpile may not provide representative long-term performance predictions. Following modelling of installation, the soil state will be transferred to a standard finite element package for the subsequent modelling of in-service performance (the MPM being considered unnecessary and computationally expensive for this phase of the life of a screwpile). In this preliminary work, we present the development of features of this numerical tool to simulate the screwpile installation. These features include a moving mesh concept (both translation and rotation) and interface elements. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated through simple examples.},

abstract = {The material-point method (MPM) is a new numerical method for analysis of large strain engineering problems. The MPM applies a dual formulation, where the state of the problem (mass, stress, strain, velocity etc.) is tracked using a finite set of material points while the governing equations are solved on a background computational grid. Several references state, that one of the main advantages of the material-point method is the easy application of complicated material behaviour as the constitutive response is updated individually for each material point. However, as discussed here, the MPM way updating and integrating stresses in time is problematic. This is discussed using an example of the dynamical collapse of a soil column.},

abstract = {The paper presents the results of the application of the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) to the analysis of landslides in reservoirs. This is a complex phenomenon, because of the interaction between the landslide, the still water in the reservoir and the dam. PFEM combines a Lagrangian approach with the solution of the governing equations of the problem using the FEM. A mesh connecting the initial set of particles (nodes) is re-generated in every time step. Some validation cases are presented, in which PFEM results are compared with experimental data. More complex calculations have been made over the actual geometry of reservoirs taken from the cartographic information of the sites. In these cases the wave generation, its propagation and dam overtopping are reproduced. Finally, Lituya bay rock slide in which 90 × 106 tons of rocks fell on the bay, generating a huge wave that caused a maximum run-up of 524 m on the opposite shore, has been simulated in 3D. The results show that PFEM is a useful tool in risk assessment related with landslides in reservoirs as it gives a good approximation to the potential affections, thus allowing the appropriate design of protection measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 CIMNE (Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya).

@phdthesis{thesis_Ceccato2015,
abstract = {The numerical simulation of real geomechanical problems often entails an high level of complexity; indeed they are often characterized by large deformations, soil-structure interaction and solid-fluid interaction. Moreover, the constitutive behavior of soil is highly non-linear. Landslides, dam failure, pile installation, and undrground excavation are typical examples of large deformation problems in which the interaction between solid a fluid phase as well as the contact between bodies are essential. This thesis addresses the challenging issue of the numerical simulation of large deformation problems in geomechanics. The standard lagrangian finite element methods are not well suited to treat extremely large deformations because of severe difficulties related with mesh distortions. The need to overcome their drawbacks urged researchers to devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques such as meshless methods and mesh based particle methods. In this study, the Material Point Method (MPM), which is a mesh based particle method, is exploited to simulate large deformation problems in geomechanics. The MPM simulates large displacements with Lagrangian material points (MP) moving through a fixed mesh. The MP discretize the continuum body and carry all the information such as mass, velocity, acceleration, material properties, stress and strains, as well as external loads. The mesh discretizes the domain where the body move through; it is used to solve the equations of motion, but it does not store any permanent information. In undrained and drained conditions the presence of water can be simulated in a simplified way using the one-phase formulation. However, in many cases the relative movement of the water respect to the soil skeleton must be taken into account, thus requiring the use of the two-phase formulation. The contact between bodies is simulated with an algorithm specifically developed for the MPM at the beginning of the century. This algorithm was originally formulated for the frictional contact. It extension to the adhesive contact is considered in this thesis, which is well suited to simulate soil-structure interaction in case of cohesive materials. In this thesis typical geomechanical problems such as the collapse of a submerged slope and the simulation of cone penetration testing are considered. Numerical results are successfully compared with experimental data thus confirming the capability of the MPM to simulate complex phenomena.},

abstract = {Material point method is a variant of the finite element method (FEM) and is successfully applied in large deformation problems. Recently, material point method has been applied in a wide range of engineering applications including solid and solid-fluid interaction problems. However, describing the behavior of incompressible materials is a challenging problem in MPM. The explicit formulation and the linear elements used in the standard MPM exhibit numerical instabilities such as mesh locking and artificial pressure oscillations in material incompressibility. Further, the small time step used to obtain a reasonable numerical stability limits the application of MPM in problems particularly with long time durations. We present an implicit treatment of the pressure term in MPM to mitigate the numerical instabilities and small time steps in incompressible material problems. The set of velocity-pressure coupled governing equations resulted by the implicit formulation is solved using Choin's projection method. The numerical examples show that the present MPM implementation is capable of modeling incompressible materials without pressure oscillations using a significantly large time step.},

abstract = {The subject of oscillatory solutions (wiggles), which sometimes result when the conventional Galerkin finite element method is employed to approximate the solution of certain partial differential equations, is addressed. It is argued that there is an important message behind these wiggles and that the appropriate response to it usually involves a combination of: re-examination of the imposed boundary conditions, judicious mesh refinement (via isoparametric elements) in critical areas, and sometimes even admitting that the problem, as posed, is just too difficult to solve adequately on an “affordable” mesh. It is further argued that it is usually an inappropriate response to develop methods which a priori suppress these wiggles and thereby make claims that these unconventional FEM techniques are actually improvements and can be used to solve difficult problems on coarse meshes.},

abstract = {The paper presents total-stress numerical analyses of large-displacement soil-structure interaction problems in geomechanics using the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). This method is characterized by frequent remeshing and the use of low order finite elements to evaluate the solution. Several important features of the method are: (i) a mixed formulation (displacement-mean pressure) stabilized numerically to alleviate the volumetric locking effects that are characteristic of low order elements when the medium is incompressible, (ii) a penalty method to prescribe the contact constraints between a rigid body and a deformable media combined with an implicit scheme to solve the tangential contact constraint, (iii) an explicit algorithm with adaptive substepping and correction of the yield surface drift to integrate the finite-strain multiplicative elasto-plastic constitutive relationship, and (iv) the mapping schemes to transfer information between successive discretizations. The performance of the method is demonstrated by several numerical examples, of increasing complexity, ranging from the insertion of a rigid strip footing to a rough cone penetration test. It is shown that the proposed method requires fewer computational resources than other numerical approaches addressing the same type of problems.},

The locking affects both the strain and the stress fields, which can lead to inaccurate results and nonphysical behavior. This paper presents a new anti-locking approach that mitigates the accumulation of fictitious strains and stresses, significantly improving the kinematic response and the quality of all field variables. The technique relies on the Hu–Washizu multi-field variational principle, with separate approximations for the volumetric and the deviatoric portions of the strain and stress fields. The proposed approach is validated using a series of benchmark examples from both solid and fluid mechanics, demonstrating the broad range of modeling possibilities within the MPM framework when combined with appropriate anti-locking techniques and algorithms.},

abstract = {A two-phase numerical model using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is applied to two-phase liquid-sediments flows. The absence of a mesh in SPH is ideal for interfacial and highly non-linear flows with changing fragmentation of the interface, mixing and resuspension. The rheology of sediment induced under rapid flows undergoes several states which are only partially described by previous research in SPH. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between the geotechnics, non-Newtonian and Newtonian flows by proposing a model that combines the yielding, shear and suspension layer which are needed to predict accurately the global erosion phenomena, from a hydrodynamics prospective. The numerical SPH scheme is based on the explicit treatment of both phases using Newtonian and the non-Newtonian Bingham-type Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou constitutive model. This is supplemented by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion to predict the onset of yielding of the sediment surface and a concentration suspension model. The multi-phase model has been compared with experimental and 2-D reference numerical models for scour following a dry-bed dam break yielding satisfactory results and improvements over well-known SPH multi-phase models. With 3-D simulations requiring a large number of particles, the code is accelerated with a graphics processing unit (GPU) in the open-source DualSPHysics code. The implementation and optimisation of the code achieved a speed up of x58 over an optimised single thread serial code. A 3-D dam break over a non-cohesive erodible bed simulation with over 4 million particles yields close agreement with experimental scour and water surface profiles.},

abstract = {The classical material point method (MPM) developed in the 90s is known for drawbacks which affect the quality of results. The movement of material points from one element to another leads to non-physical oscillations known as ‘grid crossing errors'. Furthermore, the use of material points as integration points renders a numerical quadrature rule of limited quality. Different solutions have been proposed in recent years to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper the approach of combining quadratic B-spline basis functions with a reconstruction based quadrature rule is pursued to solve these numerical problems. High-order B-spline basis functions solve the problem of grid crossing completely, whereas the considered reconstruction based quadrature rule reduces the quadrature error observed with MPM. In addition, the use of quadratic B-splines leads to a more accurate piecewise linear approximation of the stress field compared to the piecewise constant one obtained with linear Lagrangian basis functions commonly used with MPM. Two 1D benchmarks are considered involving large deformations, a vibrating bar and a column under self-weight. They render excellent results when adopting this high-order MPM.},

Homogeneous continuum models have been developed to describe material response, including Equation of State, strength, and reactive burn models. These models provide good estimates of bulk material response. However, there is little connection to underlying physics and, consequently, they cannot be applied far from their calibrated regime with confidence. Both explosives and metals have important structure at the (energetic or single crystal) grain scale. The anisotropic properties of the individual grains and the presence of interfaces result in the localization of energy during deformation. In explosives energy localization can lead to initiation under weak shock loading, and in metals to material ejecta under strong shock loading. To develop accurate, quantitative and predictive models it is imperative to develop a sound physical under...},

Seabed ploughing is an expensive and sometimes risky operation for which there are limited guidelines as to what the tow force and speed is for an expected trenching profile within a specified ground condition. Most ploughing schemes are designed using semi-empirical approaches, with very few computational tools able to take into account the geometric and material nonlinearity inherited by the ploughing problem. In this paper we describe how the Material Point Method (MPM) is being used as a numerical tool to model seabed ploughing with the aim of providing an improved predictive tool for the future, via an EPSRC-funded research project at Durham and Dundee Universities. Various issues are discussed in the paper including the means of modelling moving essential boundaries and the choice of basis functions, and this new method in MPM is demonstrated on a simple ploughing problem.},

Infrastructure construction involves the installation of structural elements, such as piles and various ground improvement techniques for soils and rocks. The installation process itself can be quasi-static (for example jacked piles) or dynamic (vibratory methods, such as stone columns and driven piles), and generally involves very large deformations and changes in pore pressure. The fact that natural soils are complex geomaterials, exhibiting structure and rate-dependent behaviour, makes analysis of such problems yet more challenging. In particular, the influence of installation on key design parameters, such as mobilised strength at the soilstructure interface and soil stiffness, is difficult to quantify and, as yet, impossible to model. Numerical analyses using the standard Finite Element Method (FEM) are unable to produce accurate descriptions of large deformation problems due to excessive mesh distortions and novel techniques need to be developed. Installation effects in geotechnical engineering presents the latest developments in monitoring, analysing and managing installation effects in geotechnical engineering, and covers aspects ranging from large deformation modelling to real field applications. Topics include: computational methods, constitutive modelling, installation effects, offshore constructions and foundations, soil improvement, and soil-structure interaction. The book is aimed at academics, researchers and practitioners in geotechnical engineering and geomechanics, and at practicing civil engineers.},

abstract = {Large deformation problems in granular soils are of great interest in the field of geotechnical engineering since most of them cause catas- trophic damages. Among them, Geophysical and gravity-driven flows such as landslides, avalanches, flowslides, and debris flows; seepage failures in mad-made structures such as levees, dikes, and embank- ments; and liquefaction of loose saturated granular soils have been extensively studied by researches. Both experimental and numerical investigations are very important to understand the mechanics and to predict failures of these problems. However, the dynamics of these problems during the failure are less explored. Experimental investi- gations on these types of large scale problems are difficult to perform and require large quantity of resources. Numerical modelling can be used to study these problems, and most of the research related to nu- merical modelling is mainly focused on identifying the unstable limit due to the limitations of the numerical methods. The material point method (MPM) is a novel numerical method that combines the best aspects of Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques and can be applied to model large deformation problems. This research consists of four main contributions in the study of large deformation problems in granular soils. First, it investigates the applicability of using continuum approaches to model dry granular flow problems us- ing MPM. Second, a fully coupled formulation is derived for MPM to model large deformation problems in fluid-saturated soils. Third, the proposed coupled MPM is implemented along with advanced features to apply for a wide range of applications and verified with analyti- cal solutions. Fourth, the coupled MPM is used to model river levee failure problems that involve large deformations.},

The formulation allows to treat solid and fluid subdomains in a unified manner in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) situations. In our work the FSI problem is solved via the particle finite element method (PFEM). The PFEM is an effective technique for modeling complex interactions between floating and submerged bodies and free surface flows, accounting for splashing of waves, large motions of the bodies and frictional contact conditions. Applications of the unified Lagrangian formulation to a number of FSI problems are given. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Dutto2017a,
abstract = {The choice of a pure cohesive or a pure frictional viscoplastic model to represent the rheological behaviour of a flowslide is of paramount importance in order to obtain accurate results for real cases. The principal goal of the present work is to clarify the influence of the type of viscous model—pure cohesive versus pure frictional—with the numerical reproduction of two different real flowslides that occurred in 1966: the Aberfan flowslide and the Gypsum tailings impoundment flowslide. In the present work, a depth-integrated model based on the v - pw Biot–Zienkiewicz formulation, enhanced with a diffusion-like equation to account for the pore pressure evolution within the soil mass, is applied to both 1966 cases. For the Aberfan flowslide, a frictional viscous model based on Perzyna viscoplasticity is considered, while a pure cohesive viscous model (Bingham model) is considered for the case of the Gypsum flowslide. The numerical approach followed is the SPH method, which has been enriched by adding a 1D finite difference grid to each SPH node in order to improve the description of the pore water evolution in the propagating mixture. The results obtained by the performed simulations are in agreement with the documentation obtained through the UK National Archive (Aberfan flowslide) and the International Commission of large Dams (Gypsum flowslide).},

@article{Laouafa2009,
abstract = {The Petacciato landslide that occurred between 1906 and 1966 along a stretch of the Adriatic coast (Italy) and the Trevoux landslide that appeared in 1983 in France are analysed using Hill's material sufficient stability condition, which is based on the sign of the second-order work. Local and global sufficient stability criteria allow detecting and describing the instability phenomena, respectively, at the material point level and for the whole domain. By considering the non-associated Plasol elasto-plastic constitutive model and the second-order work criterion, it is shown that unstable stress–strain states can be reached in plane strain conditions, strictly inside the plastic limit criterion. The two landslides that occurred in Petacciato and Trevoux are then analysed by modelling unsaturated hydro-mechanical coupling. The analysis is carried out using the Lagamine finite element code. This original approach to slope stability analysis makes it possible successfully to exhibit the landslide mechanism observed on these slopes after a long rainy period: this could not be described with the classical methods},

abstract = {This paper is dedicated to the identification of constitutive parameters of the Mohr–Coulomb constitutive model from in situ geotechnical measurements. A pressuremeter curve and the horizontal displacements of a sheet pile wall retaining an excavation are successively used as measurements. Two kinds of optimization algorithms are used to minimize the error function, the first one based on a gradient method and the second one based on a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of each algorithm related to the error function topology is discussed. Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

@article{Steffen2010,
abstract = {The material point method (MPM) is a computationally effective particle method with mathematical roots in both particle-in-cell and finite element-type methods. The method has proven to be extremely useful in solving solid mechanics problems involving large deformations and/or fragmentation of structures, problem domains that are sometimes problematic for finite element-type methods. Recently, the MPM community has focused significant attention on understanding the basic mathematical error properties of the method. Complementary to this thrust, in this paper we show how spatial and temporal errors are typically coupled within the MPM framework. In an attempt to overcome the challenge to analysis that this coupling poses, we take advantage of MPM's connection to finite element methods by developing a 'moving-mesh' variant of MPM that allows us to use finite element-type error analysis to demonstrate and understand the spatial and temporal error behaviors of MPM. We then provide an analysis and demonstration of various spatial and temporal errors in MPM and in simplified MPM-type simulations. Our analysis allows us to anticipate the global error behavior in MPM-type methods and allows us to estimate the time-step where spatial and temporal errors are balanced. Larger time-steps result in solutions dominated by temporal errors and show second-order temporal error convergence. Smaller time-steps result in solutions dominated by spatial errors, and hence temporal refinement produces no appreciative change in the solution. Based upon our understanding of MPM from both analysis and numerical experimentation, we are able to provide to MPM practitioners a collection of guidelines to be used in the selection of simulation parameters that respect the interplay between spatial (grid) resolution, number of particles and time-step. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd.},
