\label{sec:track-large-deform}

The geometric area associated with a material point is the given  the
notion \textit{voxel}. In the reference configuration, the voxel is
defined such that $V_p$ corresponds to the size of the
\textit{voxel}. The \textit{voxel} notion, was introduced by
\cite{Steffen2008}. The location of the corners associated with each
voxel at a deformed state is specified through the
deformation-gradient tensor which needs to be tracked throughout the
simulation.
Adopting this concept, a deformation gradient is associated with each
material point in the current state as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:def_gradient}
  F_p = \frac{\partl x_p}{\partial x^0} = \frac{1}{V_p^0}
  \int_{\Omega_p^0}F(x)\ d\Omega  
\end{equation}

In the initial configuration, the deformation gradient tensor is
know. Typically, an undeformed material state will be prescribed ($F^0
= I$, where $I$ is the identity tensor). An explicit forward
difference updating scheme for updating the deformation gradient is
employed as we can see in

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:update_defor_grad}
  F^{k+1} = \Delta F^{k+1} F^{k}
\end{equation}



This way of integrating the deformation gradient, using the grid
velocities, in also employed by \cite{Guilkey2003} and
\cite{love_sulsky_2006}
