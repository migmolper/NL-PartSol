\label{sec:algor-mater-point}

In this chapter, we develop several algorithms that we need for a
material point code.

\subsection{Calculus of the natural coordinates of a Gauss point}
\label{sec:calc-natur-coord}

As the one of the most important features of the MPM is its ability to
perform with a Lagrangian description of the continuum body moving the
so called integration points (Gauss points), and also with an Eulerian
description of the continuum body using the background mesh to get the
gradients. A important obstacle arrives when we try to evaluate the
finite element method shape functions employed in the background mesh.  

\subsection{Local search of Gauss points}
