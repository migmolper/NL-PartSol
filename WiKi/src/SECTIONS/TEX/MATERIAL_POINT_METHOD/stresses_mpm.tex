\subsection{Alternative approaches for updating stresses}
\label{sec:altern-appr-updat}

The question of when to update stresses has been subjected of research
by \cite{Bardenhagen2002}. In it, Bardenhagen discusses two different
ways to update the stresses, either before or after the calculation of
internal forces.
