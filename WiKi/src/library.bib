abstract = {The modelling of geomechanics problems can require a method that allows large deformations and non-linear material behaviour, in this respect the Generalised Material Point Method (GIMPM) is ideal. A fully implicit version of GIMPM has recently been developed for geomechanics problems and some aspects of its implementation are described here. An area that has received less attention in material point methods is that conventional analysis techniques constructed in terms of stress and strain are unable to resolve structural instabilities such as shear banding. This is because they do not contain any measure of the length of the microstructure of the material analysed, such as molecule size or grain structure. Gradient theories provide extensions of the classical equations with additional higher-order terms. The use of length scales makes it possible to model a finite thickness shear band which is not possible with traditional methods. Much work has been done on using gradient theories to include the effect of microstructure in the finite element method (and other numerical analysis techniques) however this yet to be combined with material point methods. In this paper the key equations that are required to extend the implicit GIMPM method to include gradient elasto-plasticity are detailed.},

abstract = {During the installation of displacement piles the soil around the pile is heavily distorted, which involves large shear deformation especially along the pile shaft and compression especially around the pile tip. This leads to a change of the stress and density state and therefore also to the soil behaviour in the adjacent area around the pile and has a significant influence on the pile bearing capacity. In general, numerical simulations of displacement piles with the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) cannot account for installation effects due to significant mesh distortion. Using the Material Point Method (MPM), however, shortcomings due to the occurring large deformations can be circumvented. In this method (Lagrangian) material points carrying the state parameters move through a (Eulerian) background mesh atwhich the equations of motion are solved. In the current paperMPMsimulations of the installation of a displacement pile in Baskarp sand using a Mohr-Coulomb model are presented. The numerical results are compared with centrifuge tests at 40g. The comparison indicates that MPM is well suited to simulate the installation process of displacement piles as well as subsequent load tests in granular soil.},

The simulation uses a strain-rate dependent Tresca constitutive model, extended with strain softening behaviour for structured clays. First, the paper replicates fall cone tests to validate the constitutive model and to select the material parameters. Afterwards, the paper shows the Sainte Monique landslide simulation which additionally considers shear band thickness to reduce the mesh-dependence. The results suggest that the strain-rate affects the prediction of the run-out distances and leads to the landslide acceleration-deceleration cycles (reported in, e.g. Corominas et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2010).},

abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to apply and improve the material-point method for modelling of geotechnical problems. One of the geotechnical phenomena that is a subject of active research is the study of landslides. A large amount of research is focused on determining when slopes become unstable. Hence, it is possible to predict if a certain slope is stable using commercial finite element or finite difference software such as PLAXIS, ABAQUS or FLAC. However, the dynamics during a landslide are less explored. The material-point method (MPM) is a novel numerical method aimed at analysing prob- lems involving materials subjected to large strains in a dynamical time–space domain. This thesis explores the material-point method with the specific aim of improving the performance for geotechnical problems. Large-strain geotechnical problems such as landslides pose a major challenge to model numerically. Employing material points to track all relevant variables and a computational grid to solve the equations of motion, the material-point method avoids some of the problematic issues associated with traditional numerical models such as the finite element method. However, several challenges for the method exist as discussed in this thesis. The thesis discusses the state of the art of the material-point method. Further, it presents ideas to better represent problems involving extreme deformations utilizing the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method (GIMP). Some of the results of this thesis are presented in the form of three research papers. The content of the individual papers are summarised below.},

@article{Coombs2018,
abstract = {Material point methods suffer from volumetric locking when modelling near incompressible materials due to the combination of a low-order computational mesh and large numbers of material points per element. However, large numbers of material points per element are required to reduce integration errors due to non-optimum placement of integration points. This restricts the ability of current material point methods in modelling realistic material behaviour. This paper presents for the first time a method to overcome finite deformation volumetric locking in standard and generalised interpolation material point methods for near-incompressible non-linear solid mechanics. The method does not place any restriction on the form of constitutive model used and is straightforward to implement into existing implicit material point method codes. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a number of two and three-dimensional examples and its correct implementation confirmed through convergence studies towards analytical solutions and by obtaining the correct order of convergence within the global Newton–Raphson equilibrium iterations. In particular, the proposed formulation has been shown to remove the over-stiff volumetric behaviour of conventional material point methods and reduce stress oscillations. It is straightforward to extend this approach to other material point methods and the presented formulation can be incorporated into all existing material point methods available in the literature.},

@article{Sulsky1994,
abstract = {A broad class of engineering problems including penetration, impact and large rotations of solid bodies causes severe numerical problems. For these problems, the constitutive equations are history dependent so material points must be followed; this is difficult to implement in a Eulerian scheme. On the other hand, purely Lagrangian methods typically result in severe mesh distortion and the consequence is ill conditioning of the element stiffness matrix leading to mesh lockup or entanglement. Remeshing prevents the lockup and tangling but then interpolation must be performed for history dependent variables, a process which can introduce errors. Proposed here is an extension of the particle-in-cell method in which particles are interpreted to be material points that are followed through the complete loading process. A fixed Eulerian grid provides the means for determining a spatial gradient. Because the grid can also be interpreted as an updated Lagrangian frame, the usual convection term in the acceleration associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized so that mesh tangling is avoided while material variables are tracked through the complete deformation history. Example solutions in two dimensions are given to illustrate the robustness of the proposed convection algorithm and to show that typical elastic behavior can be reproduced. Also, it is shown that impact with no slip is handled without any special algorithm for bodies governed by elasticity and strain hardening plasticity.},

abstract = {Slip and length measurements on earthquakes suggest large stress drop variability. We analyze an extended set of slip-length measurements for large earthquakes (M≥6) to seek for the possible origin(s) of this apparent variability. We propose that such variability arises from earthquakes breaking a variable number of major fault segments. That number depends on the strength of the inter-segment zones, which itself depends on the structural maturity of the faults. We propose new Dmax–L parameterizations based on that idea of multiple segment-ruptures. In such parameterizations, each broken segment roughly scales as a crack, while the total multi-segment rupture does not. Stress drop on individual segments is roughly constant, only varying between 3.5 to 9 MPa. The slight variation that is still observed depends on fault structural maturity; more mature faults have lower stress drops than immature ones. The new Dmax–L functions that we propose reduce uncertainties with respect to available relationships. They thus provide a more solid basis to estimate seismic hazard by integrating fault properties revealed by geological studies.},

abstract = {In this paper, AQUAgpusph, a new free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) software accelerated with OpenCL, is described. The main differences and progress with respect to other existing alternatives are considered. These are the use of the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) framework instead of the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), the implementation of the most popular boundary conditions, the easy customization of the code to different problems, the extensibility with regard to Python scripts, and the runtime output which allows the tracking of simulations in real time, or a higher frequency in saving some results without a significant performance lost. These modifications are shown to improve the solver speed, the results quality, and allow for a wider areas of application. AQUAgpusph has been designed trying to provide researchers and engineers with a valuable tool to test and apply the SPH method. Three practical applications are discussed in detail. The evolution of a dam break is used to quantify and compare the computational performance and modeling accuracy with the most popular SPH Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated alternatives. The dynamics of a coupled system, a Tuned Liquid Damper (TLD), is discussed in order to show the integration capabilities of the solver with external dynamics. Finally, the sloshing flow inside a nuclear reactor is simulated in order to show the capabilities of the solver to treat 3-D problems with complex geometries and of industrial interest.

abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless Lagrangian method that has been successfully applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), solid mechanics and many other multi-physics problems. Using the method to solve transport phenomena in process engineering requires the simulation of several days to weeks of physical time. Based on the high computational demand of CFD such simulations in 3D need a computation time of years so that a reduction to a 2D domain is inevitable. In this paper gpuSPHASE, a new open-source 2D SPH solver implementation for graphics devices, is developed.

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) for solid mechanics conserves mass and momentum by construction, but energy conservation is not explicitly enforced. Material constitutive response and internal energy are carried on discrete points (material points), while the governing equations are solved on an overlying grid. The constitutive response (and internal energy) may be updated at the beginning or end of a numerical time step without affecting mass or momentum conservation properties. Both versions of the algorithm have been applied in the literature. Here energy conservation on the material points is investigated and found to depend strongly on the version of the algorithm used. The energy error is found and partitioned into two terms, one of which is of definite sign (and dissipative). The other term is indefinite, and of opposite sign for the two algorithmic variations. It is shown analytically for a single-material-point free-vibration example that one version of the algorithm is strictly dissipative. For the other version the error terms cancel each other out and energy is conserved. The same trends are borne out in numerical solutions of free axial vibration of continuum bars as the wavelength of the vibrational mode begins to approach the computational cell size. The dissipative algorithm may be described as tending to damp out unresolved modes. For resolved modes, both algorithms give identical results, with no perceptible energy error or dissipation. It is suggested that the dissipative algorithm is a better choice in general, as the damping is consistent with the accuracy of the solution.},

abstract = {During the installation of displacement piles the soil around the pile is heavily distorted, which involves large shear deformation especially along the pile shaft and compression especially around the pile tip. This leads to a change of the stress and density state and therefore also to the soil behaviour in the adjacent area around the pile and has a significant influence on the pile bearing capacity. In general, numerical simulations of displacement piles with the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) cannot account for installation effects due to significant mesh distortion. Using the Material Point Method (MPM), however, shortcomings due to the occurring large deformations can be circumvented. In this method (Lagrangian) material points carrying the state parameters move through a (Eulerian) background mesh atwhich the equations of motion are solved. In the current paperMPMsimulations of the installation of a displacement pile in Baskarp sand using a Mohr-Coulomb model are presented. The numerical results are compared with centrifuge tests at 40g. The comparison indicates that MPM is well suited to simulate the installation process of displacement piles as well as subsequent load tests in granular soil.},

abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) uses a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to solve problems involving large deformations. A problem domain is discretised as material points which are advected on a background grid. Problems are encountered with the original MPM when material points cross between grid cells, and this has been tackled by the development of the Generalised Interpolation MPM, where material points' domains of influence extend beyond the currently occupied grid cell. In this paper, the Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) Method has been implemented implicitly in a manner that allows a global stiffness matrix to be constructed similar to that in the Finite Element Method (FEM) by combining contributions from individual elements on the background grid. An updated Lagrangian finite deformation framework has been used to ensure non-linear behaviour within each of the loadsteps. The weighting functions used for this which make the GIMP method different to standard MPM are presented and the implementation is explained. Specific details on computing the deformation gradient to be consistent with the updated Lagrangian framework and the updating of the material point influence domains are outlined, both of which are currently unclear in the published literature. It is then shown through numerical examples that for both small and large deformation elastic and elasto-plastic problems, the implicit GIMP method agrees well with analytical solutions and exhibits convergence properties between that of linear and quadratic FEM.},

abstract = {In the present work, the energy conservation properties of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are investigated in the presence of fluid–solid interactions. Similarly to the fluid phase, the solid bodies are modeled through solid particles so that the whole solid–fluid domain can be described as a unique particle system. The pressure and velocity fields are, then, extended over the solid particles in different ways, taking into account consistency issues related to the SPH differential operators and using the projection of the Navier–Stokes equations on the solid boundary. It is shown that, when solid particles are considered, the energy equation of the particle system contains some extra terms that depend on the pressure–velocity field extensions. The presence of these extra terms does not affect the consistency of the SPH model, since they tend to vanish when the spatial resolution is increased. Three prototypical numerical test cases are considered in order to provide a quantitative perspective of the matter and confirm the theoretical developments of the paper. These test cases show that the nature of these terms is globally dissipative, being thus in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In particular, the viscous extra term displays a remarkably slow rate of convergence, this being a relevant outcome for those SPH practitioners that deal with these types of flows.},

abstract = {A numerical scheme of computing quantities involving gradients of shape functions is introduced for the material point method (MPM), so that the quantities are continuous as material points move across cell boundaries. The noise and instability caused by cell crossing of the material points are then eliminated. In this scheme, the formulas used to compute these quantities can be expressed in the same forms as in the original material point method, but with the gradient of the shape function modified. For one-dimensional cases, the gradient of the shape function used in the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method is a special case of the modified gradient if the characteristic function of a material point is introduced. The characteristic function of a material point is not otherwise needed in this scheme, therefore difficulties in tracking its evolution are avoided. Although the support of the modified gradient of a shape function is enlarged from the cell containing the material point to also include the immediate neighbor cells, all the non-local effects of a material point can be accounted for by two consecutive local operations. Therefore this scheme can be used in calculations with unstructured grids. This scheme is proved to satisfy mass and momentum conservations exactly. The error in energy conservation is shown to be second order on both spatial and temporal discretizations. Although the error in energy conservation is the same order as that in the original material point method, numerical examples show that this scheme has significantly better energy conservation properties than those of the original material point method.},

abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to apply and improve the material-point method for modelling of geotechnical problems. One of the geotechnical phenomena that is a subject of active research is the study of landslides. A large amount of research is focused on determining when slopes become unstable. Hence, it is possible to predict if a certain slope is stable using commercial finite element or finite difference software such as PLAXIS, ABAQUS or FLAC. However, the dynamics during a landslide are less explored. The material-point method (MPM) is a novel numerical method aimed at analysing prob- lems involving materials subjected to large strains in a dynamical time–space domain. This thesis explores the material-point method with the specific aim of improving the performance for geotechnical problems. Large-strain geotechnical problems such as landslides pose a major challenge to model numerically. Employing material points to track all relevant variables and a computational grid to solve the equations of motion, the material-point method avoids some of the problematic issues associated with traditional numerical models such as the finite element method. However, several challenges for the method exist as discussed in this thesis. The thesis discusses the state of the art of the material-point method. Further, it presents ideas to better represent problems involving extreme deformations utilizing the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method (GIMP). Some of the results of this thesis are presented in the form of three research papers. The content of the individual papers are summarised below.},

Historical seismicity data show that in the territory of the Portuguese mainland there are active faults that are responsible for earthquakes that have caused important damage and many casualties. However, most of the intraplate earthquakes with epicentres situated in the Portuguese mainland or near the shore are normally of small magnitude and this renders difficult their interpretation in the light of focal mechanisms. A solution for one earthquake, with magnitude 5 and epicentre at the Nazar{\'{e}} submarine canyon, is presented. Southwestwards of Cape St. Vincent there is an important seismic zone responsible for high-magnitude earthquakes such as that of 1 November 1755. This zone is situated in the region where the extension of the Messejana fault into the ocean joins with the Azores-Gibraltar fault. The seismicity of the area situated between the western coast of the Portuguese mainland and the Azores increases approximately along the 15°W meridian, from the latitude of the Azores-Gibraltar fault up to 44°N. Focal mechanisms of earthquakes with epicentres situated along this line show very similar solutions. The interpretation of the focal mechanism solutions of the earthquakes with epicentres situated in the studied area shows that the stress field trends approximately NW-SE. It is assumed that this stress field results from the interaction of the Eurasian and African plates; however, this direction is not maintained in the Azores region.},

Kober Retrieved : 24 Copyright c Abstract : The Material Point Method (MPM) discrete solution procedure for computational solid mechanics is generalized using a variational form and a Petrov – Galerkin discretization scheme , resulting in a family of methods named the Generalized Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) methods . The generalization permits iden - tification with aspects of other point or node based dis - crete solution techniques which do not use a body – fixed grid , i . e . the " meshless methods " . Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified . Examples are used to demon - strate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected in MPM calculations . This noise results in non - physical local variations at the material points , where constitutive response is evaluated . It is shown to destroy the explicit solution in one case , and seriously degrade it in another . History dependent , inelastic constitutive laws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inac - curate stress states because of noisy input . The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation func - tions , and occurs due to material points crossing compu - tational grid boundaries . The next degree of smoothness available in the GIMP methods is shown to be capable of eliminating cell crossing noise . keyword : MPM , PIC , meshless methods , Petrov – Galerkin discretization .},

abstract = {A time-implicit discretization is derived and validated for the material-point method (MPM). The resulting non-linear, discrete equations are solved using Newton's method combined with either the conjugate gradient method or the generalized minimum residual method. These Newton-Krylov solvers are implemented in a matrix-free fashion for numerical efficiency. A description of the algorithms and evaluation of their performance is presented. On all test problems, if the time step is chosen appropriately, the implicit solution technique is more efficient than an explicit method without loss of desired features in the solutions. In a dramatic example, time steps 10,000 times the explicit step size are possible for the large deformation compression of a cylindrical billet at 1.2{\%} the computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Phuong2016,
abstract = {The installation of displacement piles in sand leads to severe changes in the stress state, density and soil properties around the pile tip and shaft, and therefore has a significant influence on the pile bearing capacity. Most current numerical methods predicting pile capacity do not take installation effects into account, as large deformations can lead to mesh distortion and non-converging solutions. In this study, the material point method (MPM) is applied to simulate the pile installation process and subsequent static pile loading tests. MPM is an extension of the finite element method (FEM), which is capable of modelling large deformations and soil-structure interactions. This study utilizes the moving mesh algorithm where a redefined computational mesh is applied in the convective phase. This allows a fine mesh to be maintained around the pile tip during the installation process and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme, especially for contact formulation. For the analyses a hypoplastic constitutive model for sand is used, which takes into account density and stress dependent behaviour. The model performs well in situations with significant stress level changes because it accounts for very high stresses at the pile tip. Numerical results agree with centrifuge experiments at a gravitational level of 40g. This analysis confirms the importance of pile installation effects in numerical simulations, as well as the proposed numerical approach's ability to simulate installation and static load tests of jacked displacement piles.},
