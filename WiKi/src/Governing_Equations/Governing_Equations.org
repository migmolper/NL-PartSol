** Description of motion
Considering the motion of a continuum body within wich a 
material point (particle) moves from it original psition $P$ at time $t = 0$
to its current position $p$ at time $t$, as show in the the figure
 [[fig:dis_continuum]].

The region of the three-dimensional (3D) Euclidean space occupied by the body at time $t$ is called
the *initial or undeformed configuration* ($\Omega_0$), while the region of 3D Euclidean space 
occupied by the body at time /t/  is called the *current or deformed configuration* ($\Omega$).
To measure the motion of the body, one particular configuration should be selected as the
 *reference configuration* to which the motion of the body will be referred. \\
Any possible configuration can be chosen as the reference configuration, 
but a common practice is to choose the initial configuration as the reference configuration. \\
The original position vector $X$ of a particle in the reference configuration can be expressed as 
\ref{eq:reference_config}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reference_config}
X = X_i E_i, \quad i = 1, 2, 3 
\end{equation}

where $E_i$ is the unit vector that defines the basis of the material (body-frame) coordinate 
system, and the components $X_i$ are the coordinates of the particle in the material coordinate 
system. Here, the subscripts  with the lowercase Latin alphabet, such as /i/, /j/, and /k/,
 indicate the spatial components following the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation][Einstein summation convection]], namely, 
repeated indices imply the summation over all the values of the index. The original position 
vector $X$ of the particle $P$ serves as a label to the particle. The coordinate $X_i$ are called
the *material coordinates* or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field][*Lagrangian coordinates*]]. The position of the vector $x$ of the 
particle $X$ in the current configuration, as we can see in the figure [[fig:dis_continuum]], and can
be writen as \ref{eq:current_config}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:current_config}
x = x_i e_i \quad i = 1, 2, 3
\end{equation}

where $e_i$ is the unit vector that defines the basis of the spatial coordinate system, and the
components $x_i$ are the coordinates of the particle in the spatial coordinate system. The 
coordinates $x_i$ define the spatial position of the particle such that they are called the 
*spatial coordinates* or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field][*Eulerian coordinates*]]. The motion

In  the following  derivation  of the  discrete  equations, bold  face
quantities  indicate tensor,  $\nabla$ id  the gradient  operator, $\cdot$,
and $:$  are first (vector) and second  order tensor contraction, respectively.
The subscript $p$ is used to index material point  variables   and  $i$
grid  vertex  variables. The  notation $\sum_p^{Np}$ and $\sum_i^{Np}$ 
is used to denote  summation over all material points, and over
all grid vertex, respectively.

Of  interest  in  solid  mechanics is  the  deformation  and  material
response to a continuous solid  body under prescribed loads and initial
conditions,    as   governed    by    conservation    of   mass    and
momentum.  Conservation of  mass  is satisfied  implicitly by  leaving
discrete particle  masses unchanged throughout a  computation. Here we
develop  the  discrete  version  of conservation  of  momentum,  which
permits  evolution  of  particle  momenta   in  time.  We  consider  a
deformable body acted upon by forces and subjected to either kinematic
or  traction  boundary conditions  every  where  on its  surface.  The
continuum mechanics theory

** Weak form of the updated Lagrangian Formulation

We works over the balance of momentum in the strong formulation, as we
can see in \ref{eq:sf_conserv_momentum}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sf_conserv_momentum}
\rho a = \nabla \cdot(\sigma) + \rho b  
\end{equation}

Define now a function $\psi$ belongs to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space][Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ (vectorial space
with scalar product defined) wich verifies
$a(\ddot{u},\dot{u},u,\psi)=l(\psi) \quad \forall\ \psi\ \in\
\mathcal{H}$. In other hand, in every point of $\Omega$ where we have
imposed the Dirichlet bounday condition,

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \{  \psi(x)/\psi \mid_{\Gamma_D} = 0 \quad , \quad \psi \in H^1(\Omega)  \}
\end{equation}

In other words, $\mathcal{H}$ is the space defined by all the
functions $g$, that $ \psi$ and $\nabla \psi$ are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable_function][square-integrable function]] in $\Omega$

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega}\psi\ d\Omega < \infty \quad , \quad \int_{\Omega}\nabla\psi\ d\Omega < \infty
\end{equation}

Multiplying by $\psi$ we get \ref{eq:var_conserv_momentum}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var_conserv_momentum}
\psi^T \cdot \rho a = \psi^T \cdot \nabla\cdot(\sigma) + \psi^T \cdot \rho b
\end{equation}

Integrating over $\Omega$ we get :

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \psi^T \cdot \rho a\ d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \psi^T \cdot \nabla\cdot(\sigma)\ d\Omega + \int_{\Omega} \psi^T \cdot \rho b\ d\Omega
\end{equation}

Integrating by parts the therm of the internal tension, we get :
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \psi^T\cdot \rho a\ d\Omega = \int_{\Omega}  \nabla\cdot \left( \psi^T \cdot
\sigma \right)\ d\Omega - \int_{\Omega}  \nabla\psi^T : \sigma\ d\Omega
  + \int_{\Omega} \psi^T\cdot b\ d\Omega
\end{equation}

Applying the Gauss theorem over it, and following the definition of the stress
vector $t = \sigma \cdot n$ where $n$ is the vector orthogonal to a
surface in the solid, finally we get the variational form for
conservation of momentum may be written as
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \psi^T \cdot \rho a\ d\Omega = \int_{\Gamma}  \psi^T
\cdot \overbrace{\sigma \cdot n}^{t}\ d\Gamma - \int_{\Omega}  \nabla \psi^T : \sigma\ d\Omega
  + \int_{\Omega} \psi^T b\ d\Omega  
\end{equation}
Finally we get :
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega} \psi^T \cdot \rho a\ d\Omega = \int_{\Gamma}  \psi^T
\cdot t \ d\Gamma - \int_{\Omega}  \nabla \psi^T : \sigma\ d\Omega
  + \int_{\Omega} \psi^T b\ d\Omega  
\end{equation}
